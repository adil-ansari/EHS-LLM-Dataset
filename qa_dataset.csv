Question,Answer
"A 64 yr. old male twists his knee and is treated with a Non-prescription medication, and is sent for further diagnostic purposes (MRI). Upon completion of the MRI it is determined that there was no injury to the knee but the patient was diagnosed with arthritis and treated with a prescription strength medication for the arthritis. Is this a recordable case?","If the arthritis is wholly caused by non-work factors, then it is not work-related and should not be recorded in the OSHA records."
A company has been notified that an employee may have been exposed to TB while overseas while working. Is this a recordable case?,"No. Employers are only required to record injuries and illnesses if they occur within the geographic coverage of the OSH Act. The Occupational Safety and Health Act, and therefore the OSHA Recordkeeping Regulation, apply only within the jurisdictional boundaries of the United States as defined in Section 4(a) of the Act. If the exposure had occurred in the United States, the case would be recordable if that employee subsequently developed a tuberculosis infection, as evidenced by a positive skin test or diagnosis by a physician or other licensed health care professional."
A company is located with multiple buildings within one complex. Can I produce one log for the complex or do I need to have one log for each building?,"You may complete one log for the complex. Generally, there should be one log per ""establishment"". An establishment is defined as a single physical location and can include campus and complex type locations."
"A corporation pays a licensed professional to offer massage on-site as an employee benefit. The employee chooses by their own to see the on-site professional. Because the work the employee does is physical, he benefits from the soft tissue therapy and uses the service as needed. When should an employee's condition be categorized as recordable upon receipt of the massage?",Massage therapy is considered first aid and is included as item M in the rule's first aid list. Message therapy does not make a case recordable.
"A doctor places an employee on restricted duty but the employer can not accommodate the restrictions and, as a result, the employee is losing time. Are the lost days recorded as lost time or restricted duty?","You must count the days as days away from work. To count days as restricted days, restricted work activity must be made available to the employee."
"A dust particle is removed from the eye using a cotton swab, but prescription eye drops are given to prevent the possibility of infection. Do the eye drops make the case recordable even though they were only precautionary?","Yes, the case is recordable. Any use of RX medicine in treating a work-related injury or illness is considered medical treatment regardless of purpose prescribed."
"A health care worker was exposed to pertussis and was given an antibiotic by a medical provider as a preventative measure. We know that the mere exposure is not recordable. However, does the fact that the antibiotic was given make it recordable?","If an employee is exposed to pertussis (or other communicable diseases) and does NOT exhibit any symptoms of the disease, the administration of prophylactic antibiotics does not make the case recordable. Please note if the employee shows ANY signs or symptoms of the disease and is given antibiotics, then the case is recordable."
A host employer has contracted employees for their nursing services. The host employer supervises the contracted employees on a day-to-day basis. Would the fact that the company that provides the contract employees has an office on the host's physical location affect the decision on who records the injuries and illnesses of these workers?,No. The host company must record the injuries and illnesses of these workers because the host provides the day-to-day supervision.
A part time employee who works an average of 18 hours per week is injured. She is put on restrictions. Would I count each day that she has been on restrictions or just count 2-3 days per week because that's how many days she normally works?,"You must count the number of calendar days the employee was restricted as a result of the injury, regardless of whether or not the employee was scheduled to work on those day(s)."
A person is injured at work and is away from work as a result. During that time the person develops depression and is unable to come back to work. The person has a diagnosis from a physician which says that it is a mental health disorder related to the injury. Is the depression recorded as a separate case?,"Because the depression is a manifestation of the original injury, and no additional or new work exposure caused or contributed to the depression, it does not meet the ""new case"" criteria. Any time away from work associated with the depression would be included on the originally recorded case."
"A physician has diagnosed an employee with carpal tunnel syndrome. There has been no lost/restricted/transfer days or medical treatment beyond first aid. Does carpal tunnel in this case fall under 1904.7(b)(7) as a ""significant injury or illness diagnosed by a physician""?",No. Carpal tunnel syndrome is not considered a significant injury or illness as defined under 1904.7(b)(7). Work-related CTS is recordable if it meets one or more of the general recording criteria (medical treatment beyond first aid; days away from work; restricted work activity; job transfer).
"A physician includes in a worker's restrictions ""no driving"" and the worker stays home even though he could take public transportation, or get a ride to work from a co-worker. Would those days be counted as days restricted or days away from work?","The case must be recorded in a manner reflecting what actually occurs. If the employee does not make it to work, the case must be recorded as a case involving days away from work. If the employee is driven to work by the employer or anyone else, and the employee performs restricted work, the case must be recorded as a case involving restricted work activity."
A resident in our nursing home bit a staff member. The skin of the staff member was broke. We conducted standard washing of the wound and an HIV test was given. There was no loss of work. Should this incident be logged on the OSHA 300?,"No. A human bite is recordable only if it requires medical treatment beyond first aid, restrictions, or days away from work or if it results in a loss of consciousness."
"A salesman, who works out of his private home, slips and falls on ice in his driveway. The employee states he was carrying company property at the time of his fall. Is this work-related?","No. Injuries and illnesses that occur while an employee is working at home are considered work-related if the injury or illness occurs while the employee is performing work for pay or compensation in the home, and the injury or illness is directly related to the performance of work rather than to the general home environment or setting. Ice outside the home is part of the general home setting."
A supervisor was shouting at an employee. The employee felt stressed and his general doctor told him to take some time off from work. Is this an OSHA 300 recordable case?,"Mental illnesses, such as depression or anxiety disorder, that have work-related stress as a contributing factor, are recordable if the employee voluntarily provides the employer with an opinion from a physician or other licensed health care professional with appropriate training and experience (psychiatrist, psychologist, psychiatric nurse practitioner, etc.) stating that the employee has a mental illness that is work-related, and the case meets one or more of the general recording criteria."
A temporary worker is injured and has a job restriction recommended by the physician. The temporary services placement agency reassigns the person to another job in another company where the person can be more productive. Does the injury count as one day of restricted work activity or do you estimate the number of days of restriction that would have been needed?,Since the worker was reassigned because of the injury you must estimate the number of days of restricted work activity that would have been needed and use that estimate as your entry.
A worker got his nail half broken off while handling the steel rods at a construction site. He was given first aid and the remainder of the nail was removed by a medical practitioner as a precautionary measure to avoid any infection. Is this recordable?,Yes. Removal of the nail is considered medical treatment beyond first aid. Note that drilling of the fingernail to relieve pressure for subungual hematoma is considered First Aid.
A worker has an exposure in the work environment and it causes an allergic reaction. The worker then uses their prescribed epipen or inhaler. Does the use of this device make this a recordable case?,Yes.  An allergic reaction to an exposure in the work environment is recordable once they used their prescription medication (epinephrine / inhaler).
"A worker is participating in a ""lineman's rodeo"", sponsored by the employer, on the employer's property, but not on company time. The worker falls and injures his back and breaks his leg. He is off work for weeks. Is this an OSHA recordable injury?","You are not required to record an injury or illness if the injury or illness results solely from voluntary participation in a recreational activity. Conversely, if the employee was at the rodeo as a condition of employment, the case would be work related and recordable."
"A worker receives a laceration on a work site. The worker is seen by the on-site nurse, who assesses the laceration injury and deems it treatable through the use of non-invasive means (e.g. steri-strips and/or Band-Aids). After work on the same day, the worker goes to the hospital for another assessment of the injury. The physician at the hospital assesses and decides to suture the wound. Is the employer permitted to deem the on-site nurse as having the most authoritative opinion, and therefore, able to classify the injury as a first aid and not a medical treatment?","If the two examinations in the scenario meet the following criteria, the employer may rely on the first opinion as the most authoritative: It is imperative that the physicians involved in the examination of the employee see the exact same condition. If the employee's condition either improves or worsens between the examinations the concept does not apply. Several criteria must be met to ensure the medical professionals involved are seeing the same condition: 1) Examination of the patient must be in person (i.e. review of documents only cannot be substituted for a physical examination); 2) The examinations must be contemporaneous; 3) The employee was not subject to additional exposures between the examinations; and 4) No medical treatment, restricted work activity, or days away from work occurred between the examinations. If any one of these criteria is not met, it is likely the health care professionals are not seeing the same condition. If all of these criteria are met the employer may relay on the most authoritative medical opinion. OSHA will consider a medical opinion that is the best documented, best reasoned and most persuasive as the most authoritative opinion."
"A worker was walking down the office corridor, tripped and required medical treatment for a twisted ankle. There was nothing in the workplace that caused the fall (no tripping hazards, no slippery floor, no uneven surface, nothing or anyone on his way). Is this recordable?","OSHA's no-fault recordkeeping system requires recording work-related injuries and illnesses that occur in the work environment, regardless of the level of employer control or non-control involved. A case is presumed work-related if, and only if, an event or exposure in the work environment is a discernable cause of the injury or illness. The act of tripping is a clear event within the work environment that caused the injury, establishing work relatedness."
An employee arrived at work 45 minutes early one day and had a bug bite him on the finger. It turned a little red. The nurse wiped it off with an alcohol swab gave him some prescription antibiotic cream for one application. Is this an OSHA recordable case?,Yes. For purposes of OSHA recordkeeping injuries and illnesses occurring in the work environment are considered work-related. Punching in and out with a time clock (or signing in and out) does not affect the outcome for determining work-relatedness. The prescription antibiotic is considered medical treatment beyond first aid.
"An employee arrives for work. As she is walking across the parking lot prior to the start of her shift, she is bitten by a wasp/bee and has an allergic reaction. She is taken to the doctor where she is given an injection and a prescription. Is this case recordable?","Yes, this is a recordable case. The parking lot is considered part of the establishment and thus the work environment. Punching in/out on a time clock does not determine work relatedness. The bee sting is considered a work related injury and the employee was administered a prescription, which is medical treatment."
An employee bumped his knee on machine guard door. Several days later went to the doctors due to swelling. During the visit the physician drains 3cc of fluid from the employee's knee. Is this recordable?,"Yes. Draining fluids is considered medical treatment except for relieving pressure from a fingernail or toenail, or draining fluid from a blister."
"An employee claims he hurt himself at work. He takes it upon himself to take one or two days off using his own personal time. He does not provide us with any medical documentation to back up his being unable to work and claims he doesn't need to see a doctor, he just want to rest for a day or two. Do we need to record this as a days away from work case if we question that there is no medical evidence that he needed the time off?",The employee's decision does not determine the outcome for recordability. Nor is a medical opinion required in this situation. The employer must make a good faith decision as to whether the employee needed the days away from work for recuperation or not and record appropriately.
"An employee comes in to work and they are extremely distraught and stressed due to personal matters outside of work. While at work, the employee has an anxiety attack and faints. Would this be considered an OSHA recordable?","Injuries and illnesses that result solely from non-work-related events or exposures are not recordable under the exception at 1904.5(b)(2)(ii). Mental illnesses, such as anxiety disorder, are recordable only if the employee voluntarily provides the employer with an opinion from a physician or other licensed health care professional with appropriate training and experience (psychiatrist, psychologist, psychiatric nurse practitioner, etc.) stating that the employee has a mental illness that is work-related, and the case meets one or more of the general recording criteria."
An employee died of a heart attack during working hours. He died while sitting in the lobby talking with a co-worker. The employee has a history of hypertension and high blood pressure. Is this case recordable?,"If the case is wholly caused by non-work factors, then it is not work-related and will not be recorded in the OSHA records. If work contributed to the illness in some way, for example the work is strenuous or the work environment is very hot, then it would be work-related and recordable."
"An employee exited the building, and slipped and fell (suffering a sprained knee) while clearing snow from their personal vehicle prior to exiting the parking lot. Does the act of clearing snow qualify for the exception listed in 29 CFR 1905(b)(2)(v) for activities that are personal tasks unrelated to their employment?","Clearing the snow off his personal vehicle in the company parking lot does not meet the personal tasks exemption. The company parking lot, where the injury occurred, is a part of the employer's establishment. Because none of the work-related exceptions under 1904.5(b)(2) apply to the event, the case is work related."
"An employee experienced an injury or illness in the work environment before they had ""clocked in"" for the day. Is the case considered work related even if that employee was not officially ""on the clock"" for pay purposes?","Yes. For purposes of OSHA recordkeeping injuries and illnesses occurring in the work environment are considered work-related. Punching in and out with a time clock (or signing in and out) does not affect the outcome for determining work-relatedness. If the employee experienced a work-related injury or illness, and it meets one or more of the general recording criteria under section 1904.7, it must be entered on the employer's OSHA 300 log."
"An employee finishes his scheduled work day at 5 PM and clocks out. The employee leaves the employer's building and walks on a publically owned sidewalk towards his car. The car is parked in a church parking lot, where the church has agreed to allow the employees to park. While approaching his car, the employee trips and fractures his ankle, requiring medical treatment beyond first aid. Would this be considered an OSHA recordable injury?","No, this injury is not work-related. A parking area where the employer does not have control, such as the church parking lot described in your question, would not be considered part of the employer's establishment, and therefore not part of the work environment."
"An employee from FL traveled to Las Vegas for work. He went out to dinner, slipped on the wet floor at the restaurant, fell and had a concussion and closed head injury. He was taken by ambulance to the nearest hospital. He did receive medical treatment and was out for 2 days. Should this be recorded?","Injuries and illnesses that occur while an employee is on travel status are work-related if, at the time of the injury or illness, the employee was engaged in work activities ""in the interest of the employer."" Examples of such activities include travel to and from customer contacts, conducting job tasks, and entertaining or being entertained to transact, discuss, or promote business (work-related entrainment includes only entertainment activities being engaged in at the direction of the employer). If attending the dinner was a directed work activity, the case is work related and recordable. If it was merely his personal dinner, the case is not work related and therefore not recordable."
An employee gets a minor laceration but refuses first-aid treatment. The laceration later becomes infected and requires prescription antibiotics. Can I leave this case off my log because he refused initial treatment that would have prevented the infection?,"No. Even if the employee refused first aid treatment for the work-related injury , the case must be recorded once it required medical treatment beyond first aid."
An employee got something is his eye (dirt/dust) during the workday. At the end of the day the employee went home. During the evening the employee's eye became more irritated and he decided to seek medical attention the next morning before reporting to work. The doctor flushed the eye with saline solution and sent to employee back to work. The employee was away from work for 3 hours. Does this absence make the case recordable?,No. Time spent seeking medical treatment is not counted as restricted work activity if the employee otherwise was capable of performing all of their routine job functions.
"An employee has a repetitive motion injury to the shoulder. The treating physician does not recommend any medical restrictions. However, the physician does give the employee a cortisone injection consisting of 1 cc xylocaine plain and .5 cc of depo medrol. Is this recordable?","Yes, this is a recordable case because a prescription medication was issued."
"An employee has a work-related shoulder injury resulting in days of restricted work activity. While working on restricted duty, the employee sustains a foot injury which results in a different work restriction. How would the employer record these cases?","For purposes of OSHA recordkeeping the employer would stop the count of the days of restricted work activity due to the first case, the shoulder injury, and enter the foot injury as a new case and record the number of restricted work days. If the restriction related to the second case, the foot injury, is lifted and the employee is still subject to the restriction related to their shoulder injury, the employer must resume the count of days of restricted work activity for that case."
"An employee has an injury to his left wrist and went to the doctor and was given restrictions. The case was recorded. Now the employee, weeks later, told the doctor that the right wrist hurts and was given restrictions for that wrist. Is this considered part of the first recordable case?","Because the right wrist injury involved additional and new work related exposure, OSHA would consider these as two separate and recordable cases."
An employee has his coat hanging over a chair at work and has a chicken sandwich in the pocket. The employee reaches into the pocket to get the sandwich and receives multiple fire ant bites on his hand. Is this work-related? Company policy is to disallow food being present at work except if it is kept in a locker or other container away from the work post.,"Yes, this case is work related. You must consider an injury or illness to be work-related if an event or exposure in the work environment either caused or contributed to the resulting condition or significantly aggravated a pre-existing injury or illness. Work-relatedness is presumed for injuries and illnesses resulting from events or exposures occurring in the work environment, unless an exception in § 1904.5(b)(2) specifically applies. There is no exception for insect or animal bites or stings."
"An employee hurt his back lifting an object on Saturday. He called off Monday and Tuesday due to his back. He came to work on Wednesday, and then reported the injury. Do I need to record this as a case with days away from work?",The employee's decision does not determine the outcome for recordability. Nor is a medical opinion required in this situation. The employer must make a good faith decision as to whether the employee needed the days away from work for recuperation or not and record appropriately.
An employee hurts his or her left arm and is told by the doctor not to use the left arm for one week. The employee is able to perform all of his or her routine job functions using only the right arm (though at a slower pace and the employee is never required to use both arms to perform his or her job functions). Would this be considered restricted work?,"No. If the employee is able to perform all of his or her routine job functions (activities the employee regularly performs at least once per week), the case does not involve restricted work. Loss of productivity is not considered restricted work."
"An employee injured his back while lifting up a piece of heavy pipe. After work was over he went to see his chiropractor. The chiropractor conducted a few manipulations on the employees back, and according to our employee, he was like new. Is chiropractic care considered medical treatment beyond first aid?","Yes, chiropractic treatment is considered medical treatment for recordkeeping purposes."
An employee injured his finger. After medical treatment he completed his shift. He worked for a day and further medical referral advised him to have a surgery and rest for 9 days. How do we count the lost days? Should we count the days from the day after he had the injury or from the day of further medical referral?,You may begin counting the days away from work from the time of the surgery.
An employee is bitten on the arm by a patient and the skin is slightly broken with little bleeding present. No medical treatment (beyond first aid) was needed and the case did not involve any days away or restrictions. Is this recordable?,"This case is not recordable. While there is an exposure to potentially infectious material, it was not a needlestick or sharps injury, and it did not require medical treatment beyond first aid or the other general recording criteria."
An employee is exposed to someone diagnosed with meningitis in their work place. The employee is provided antibiotics as a prophylaxis. Is this recordable?,"No. To be recordable on the OSHA log an injury or illness must exist. Exposures without signs or symptoms of the illness are not recordable, even if medical treatment is administered."
"An employee is fatally shot by a criminal attempting to steal from the work site. The victim did not confront or interact with the criminal, he was simply shot for being in the way. Should this be recorded as a work-related fatality?","Yes, there is no exception to work relatedness for incidents involving workplace violence. The case should also reported by telephone or in person to the Area Office of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), U.S. Department of Labor, that is nearest to the site of the incident. You may also use the OSHA toll-free central telephone number, 1-800-321-OSHA (1-800-321-6742)."
An employee is going to their car to obtain personal paperwork during her normal working hours. While walking to her car she trips and breaks her foot. Does this constitute a work related injury since she was conducting non-work related business at the time of the injury occurring?,The case is work-related and recordable. An injury or illness is work-related if an event or exposure in the work environment either caused or contributed to the resulting condition or significantly aggravated a pre-existing injury or illness. The company parking lot is part of the work-environment. Retrieving personal property during work hours does not meet any of the exceptions to work-relatedness.
"An employee is hired from a local union hall for a short duration. If the employee suffers a lost time injury, but the job is finished days later and the employee is laid off due to a lack of work, does the employer have to continue counting the days away from work until the employee is returned to full duty status by the treating physician?",No. You may end the day count when the employee is laid off due to the end of the job.
"An employee is injured and placed on restricted work activity. He is told not to lift more than 15 lbs. If the employee is transferred to a different job because of a company wide reorganization, and the new job does not require lifting more than 15 lbs., can I stop the day count of restricted work activity?","You may stop the day count. When you permanently assign the injured or ill employee to a job that permanently eliminates the routine functions the employee was restricted from performing, you may stop the day count when the modification or change is made permanent. You must count at least one day of restricted work or job transfer for such cases."
An employee is injured on Monday; however he did not feel medical treatment was necessary. On Thursday the employee was sent to the doctor and returns to work the same day with restrictions. Is Thursday counted as the first day of restricted work activity?,Yes. You count Thursday as a day of restricted work activity because it is subsequent to the day of injury.
An employee is off the worksite for lunch and has an incident that results in injury. The employee is an hourly employee whom gets a paid lunch. Does this then become a recordable since he is on the clock when the injury occurred?,No. The case is not work-related because the employee was not within the work environment and he was not present as a condition of employment or engaged in a work activity.
"An employee is performing a work related duty, receives an injury requiring sutures to close, and is subsequently terminated for failing a post accident drug test. Is this case recordable?","Yes, this case is recordable. The injury is work related and required medical treatment. The fact that the employee failed the drug test is not considered in the decision making process."
"An employee is provided antibiotics for anthrax, although the employee does not test positive for exposure/infection. Is this a recordable event on the OSHA log?","No. A case must involve a death, injury, or illness to be recordable. A case involving an employee who does not test positive for exposure/infection would not be recordable because the employee is not injured or ill."
An employee is terminated and then the next day he turned in paperwork for a worker's compensation claim. Do I need to record this claim on the OSHA log since he was no longer on the payroll? His doctor provided a note to allow him to return to work with restrictions.,"If the illness or injury is considered to be work-related, you must record the injury or illness and estimate the number of days the employee would have been on work restriction. You would check column (I) ""Job transfer or restriction"" and estimate the number of days in Column (L)."
An employee is walking into work and collapses as a result of a heart attack. Is this a recordable case?,"If the employee has a preexisting condition (heart issues), the employer needs to make a determination on whether there was an event or exposure in the work environment that may have aggravated this illness. If it is determined the heart attack is solely the result of a non-work-related condition the case need not be recorded on the OSHA Log."
"An employee misstepped and his knee buckled. When being examined by the doctor an MRI was ordered. The MRI confirmed long term damage to the knee including bone-on-bone and cartilage damage. Would this condition meet the exception under 1904.5(b)(2)(ii) ""The injury or illness involves signs or symptoms that surface at work but result solely from a non-work-related event or exposure that occurs outside the work environment""? The employee was provided prescription medication for his knee.","If an employee has a preexisting condition the employer needs to make a determination on whether the event or exposure in the work environment aggravated this pre-existing condition to the point where it needed medical treatment that otherwise would not have been needed. If so, the case is work related and recordable."
An employee of a temp service contracted to work at my company was injured and needed some medical treatment. Am I responsible to record this injury on my company's 300 log?,"You must record the injury if you supervise the employee on a day-to-day basis.  Day-to-day supervision occurs when in addition to specifying the output, product or result to be accomplished by the person's work, the employer supervises the details, means, methods and processes by which the work is to be accomplished."
"An employee on business travel has checked into his temporary home away from home, and reported to his work location first thing in the morning. At lunch that day, the employee goes to a local restaurant to eat with a coworker. When walking to the restaurant the employee trips on a curb, falls and breaks his wrist. Is this injury required to be recorded?","This is not a work-related or recordable injury as long as the lunch is not considered a work activity directed by the employer. Normally, injuries and illnesses that occur to employees who are off the employer's premises during their lunch break is not a work-related or recordable injury."
"An employee out on 8 week maternity leave, visits the site during leave, to turn in some documents, trips and falls in the parking lot when leaving. The employee is not coming to work, is not leaving work, is not scheduled to work. There is no rule requiring the documents be turned in personally. They can be dropped off, mailed, messengered. Is this recordable?","Yes, she is on the premises in the capacity of an employee (not a member of the general public), therefore the case is considered work-related."
"An employee parked his vehicle in a shared parking lot prior to coming to work (not a ""company parking lot""). As he exited his vehicle, he tripped and was injured . Is this injury work related?","No, this injury is not work-related. A parking area where the employer does not have control (such as a parking lot outside of a building shared by different employers, or a public parking area like those found at a mall or beneath a multi-employer office building) would not be considered part of the employer's establishment, and therefore not part of the work environment."
"An employee receives an insect bite, goes to the doctor and receives a prescription medication. Is this injury a recordable?",Yes. An insect bite that occurs in the work environment is a work related injury. Treatment with a prescription medication is medical treatment which makes the case recordable.
An employee reported a foreign body in one of his eyes from the night before. He stated that he did not feel anything go into his eye during the course of the previous work day. When he got home from work he took a shower and later felt something in his eye. Is this work related?,"No. If there is no indication that an exposure took place within the work environment, you do not have to consider the case work related. Work-relatedness is presumed for injuries and illnesses resulting from events or exposures occurring in the work environment, unless an exception in 1904.5(b)(2) specifically applies. Because the injury arose outside of the work environment, the presumption does not apply."
"An employee reports an injury, but does not see a physician for a period of time (a week, for example) and continues to work during that period. Then the physician lists a work restriction. Would I count the calendar days from the day after the injury or from the date the physician started the restricted duty?",Start counting the number of calendar days for restricted work when the physician assigned the restricted work activity.
"An employee reports to his supervisor that he has been experiencing some neck pain for about 2 weeks, but did not report it because he felt he could work through it, and it would resolve itself. The employee is sent to the doctor on the day he reported the injury, and is placed on restricted duty for the remainder of that day, and can return to his regular job the next day. No medical treatment was provided. Is this case recordable?",This is a recordable case because it involved restricted work activity subsequent to the day of injury or onset of illness.
"An employee retires on June 30th. Prior to that, he had been receiving first aid for a work related injury. On July 6th, the employee's personal doctor writes the employee a prescription for the work related injury. Is this recordable?","Yes, the case should be recorded. 1904.7(b) (3) (viii) allows the employer to stop a day count when an employee retires, but it does not allow the employer to avoid recording a case that meets the recording criteria. This case is work related and required medical treatment."
An employee sees a doctor for a scratched eye that was already flushed by the on-site nurse. The doctor provides the employee with a sample bottle of prescription antibiotic eye drops. No prescription was written. Does this count as an OSHA recordable incident?,"Yes. Once the sample medication was provided to the employee, the case became recordable."
"An employee slips on ice and falls, sustaining an injury. The slip/fall occurred in the parking lot where most of our employees - as well as employees of other employers occupying the same building - use to access the workspace we lease in the building. The parking lot is NOT owned by our company, and is not under our control. Is this recordable?","No. A parking area where the employer does not have control (such as a parking lot outside of a building shared by different employers, or a public parking area like those found at a mall or beneath a multi-employer office building) would not be considered part of the employers establishment (except for the owner of the building or mall), and therefore not a company parking lot for purposes of OSHA recordkeeping. This case is not considered work-related or recordable."
An employee sprained his ankle and was told by the physician to use crutches for five days. No other treatment was provided. Is this case recordable?,"The use of crutches are not considered medical treatment beyond first aid for OSHA recordkeeping purposes. However, if the use of the crutches prevents the employee from coming to work or restricts the employee from performing their routine job functions, the case must be recorded."
"An employee states on Dec. 30th 2002 that her hand hurts. On January 3rd she goes to a doctor and is now preparing for surgery. On which year's log is the case recorded, 2002 or 2003?","Record the case on the 2002 Log. Ordinarily, the case should be recorded on the Log for the year in which the injury or illness occurred. Where the date of injury or illness cannot be determined, the date the employee reported the symptoms or received treatment must be used."
"An employee suffered a blow to the head during the scope of employment. After having been sent to the clinic for evaluation, he was given two days off from work (the date of injury and the following day) as a precaution to watch for signs of a concussion or other brain trauma. Nothing was found and the employee was returned to work full duty on the 3rd day, with a final evaluation a week later to release from medical care. Because the day off was given as precaution, does this make it a recordable day away from work case even though the employee was deemed ok and later released to full duty?",The day following the date of injury is considered a day away from work and makes the case recordable. The fact that the day away was put in place for precautionary reasons is not a consideration of whether the case is OSHA recordable.
"An employee suffered an injury on Thursday (sprained finger) and continued working. He did not report the injury until Friday morning. On Friday morning, the employee went to the doctor and came back to work with a splint and restrictions that resulted in him not being able to perform his normal job. We were able to find another job the employee could perform. Should we count Friday as a day on job transfer because the injury occurred the day before, or do we not count Friday because it was not technically a recordable injury until the employee received the splint?",Count Friday as a day of job transfer. You begin counting days on the day after the injury occurred.
An employee suffers a work-related injury and the doctor returns him to work on restricted duty with no time lost. The employer cannot accommodate the work restrictions so the employee is sent home. Do we have to record this as a days away case?,"Yes, this case needs to be recorded as ""Days away from work"" column (H). To classify a case as a restricted work activity case, the employer must have and offer restricted work activity to the injured or ill employee."
"An employee sustained a work related injury and was placed on restriction pending a follow up appointment with the physician. This employee missed his follow up appointment and is now on a personal leave of absence unrelated to his injury. Despite repeated attempts, I have been unable to contact this employee in order to reschedule his follow up appt. Am I required to continue counting restricted days on this employee while he is off?","You can stop the day count on the date of the missed follow-up appointment. If subsequent documentation indicates further time for recuperation was needed, update the original entry to reflect the new information."
An employee sustained a work related injury and was placed on restriction pending a follow-up appointment with the physician. There was no end date to the restrictions provided at the first visit. On two occasions the employee missed a scheduled follow-up visit and does not want to be seen the physician. When may I stop the day count?,"You can stop the day count on the date of the first missed follow-up appointment. If subsequent documentation indicates further time for recuperation was needed, update the original entry to reflect the new information."
"An employee sustained a work related injury and was placed on restriction. She worked for a few days with the restriction and then went on a pre-planned vacation. During her vacation, she followed up with the physician who maintained her restriction. She plans on using her vacation time and then retire for reasons not related to the injury. She may not return to work between the time her vacation ends and her retirement begins. At what point may I stop counting restricted days on this employee?",You can stop the day count on the day she retires since the retirement is unrelated to the injury.
"An employee sustained an allergic reaction to a mosquito bite and was given a steroid shot as medical treatment. Is this considered first aid treatment (and therefore not OSHA recordable), or is this considered a recordable incident?",A steroid injection is a prescription medication and is considered medical treatment. The case is recordable.
"An employee sustains a back injury in 2015. She was in continuous pain and finally had surgery 1 year later. During the surgery a nerve was damaged. Now in 2017 she had further surgery to repair the damaged nerve and will have days missed from work as a result. Is this, for record keeping purposes, considered ""days away from work"" as it was related to the botched surgery and not to the actual injury?","The days away from work required by the 2017 surgery should be added to the originally recorded case. But for the work-related injury, the employee would not have required the original surgery. The consequences of the surgery are therefore associated with the work injury."
"An employee trips in the company parking lot over a curb or parking chock at 4:35 PM after clocking out at 4:30 PM. The resultant injury requires sutures so is more than first aid. Even though the employee has suffered a recordable level injury on company property does the fact that the employee is off the clock, make this case not recordable?",Punching in or out of a time clock does not determine the outcome for work-relatedness.  This case is work-related and recordable.
"An employee walked outside our facility and was stung by a bee. She is highly allergic and sought medical treatment that resulted in treatment beyond first aid. Although she was not in the course of her job duties, would this be considered a recordable case?","Since the employee was still on the employer's premises when she walked outside, this is considered a work related a injury. The case should be recorded because she received medical treatment beyond first aid."
An employee was bitten by a tick. The employee was seen by an MD to ensure that the tick had been completely removed by the employee. The doctor gave the employee a single dose of antibiotic as a prophylaxis against Lyme disease. The employee was not ill or showing any symptoms. Is this recordable on the OSHA 300 log?,"The case is recordable. Insect and animal bites that occur within the work environment are work-related injuries. The use of the prescription antibiotic makes the case recordable. The preventive, precautionary or prophylactic nature of a medication is not controlling for OSHA recordability"
"An employee was coming to work, parked their car in the employee parking lot, got out of the car and proceeded to slip and fall (incurring an injury), prior to entering the work site. The employee was evaluated and lost time from work. Would this be a OSHA recordable injury?","Yes. A company owned parking lot is considered part of the establishment and therefore within the work environment. An injury or illness is considered work-related if an event or exposure in the work environment caused or contributed to the injury or illness or significantly aggravated a pre-existing injury or illness.  Because the injury occurred in the work environment and required days away from work, the case is recordable."
"An employee was diagnosed with a work related hernia and received an experimental surgery to repair it. The surgery failed and now requires 2 more corrective surgeries spread over a 6-month period, during which time he is unable to work. Does the employer have to record 180 days of lost time because of the surgeon's error?",Yes. The initial and subsequent surgeries are to repair the work-related hernia. All of the lost time entailed must be counted towards the case. The fact that a surgical error occurred is not considered.
"An employee was exiting the cafeteria at work and stopped to help clean up spilled salad dressing. He slipped and fell. Would this be considered work related as he was not in the scope of his duties? He has a desk job, was just helping.","The case is work related. Injuries and illnesses occurring in the work environment are considered work-related unless they meet one of the exceptions listed under 1904.5(b) (2). The work environment includes the establishment and other locations where one or more employees are working or are present as a condition of their employment. OSHA's no-fault recordkeeping system requires recording work-related injuries and illnesses from events or exposures that occur in the work environment, regardless of the level of employer control or non-control involved."
An employee was going for lunch and sprained his left ankle while rushing and slipping down a staircase in an office building. His reason for rushing is he did not want to keep his colleagues waiting for him. X-ray at hospital showed no fracture and he was given 3 days medical leave to recuperate at home. The staircase was brightly illuminated without any slip hazards. Is this incident considered to be recordable?,"This is a work-related and recordable injury. OSHA's no-fault recordkeeping system requires recording work-related injuries and illnesses that occur in the work environment, regardless of the level of employer control or non-control involved. A case is presumed work-related if, and only if, an event or exposure in the work environment is a discernable cause of the injury or illness. The act of slipping down the staircase is a clear event within the work environment that caused the injury, establishing work relatedness. The time needed to recuperate makes the case recordable."
"An employee was hurt on 2/25, goes to ER and the doctor states she can return to work in two days. She is out 2/26 and 2/27, has off 2/28, takes a personal day 3/1 and returns to works on 3/2. Do I count 2 days out or 4 days?",You count two days as directed by the physician.
"An employee was in our company parking lot, stepped out of her car and fell as she stepped out of the car. She injured her arm. Is this case work-related?","Yes. Company parking lots are part of the work environment. Work-relatedness is presumed for injuries and illnesses resulting from events or exposures occurring in the work environment, unless an exception in § 1904.5(b)(2) specifically applies. There is no exception for falls under 1904.5(b)(2)."
"An employee was injured and received first aid by a physician at a local hospital and was given a prescription for a pain killer ""to be filled if necessary"". Is this recordable?","Yes. Once a prescription is written, this is a recordable injury, even if the it was ""fill as needed"" and not filled."
"An employee was injured on 9/21. He went to the Urgent Care doctor, who sent him to the hospital for an MRI. The doctor required the employee to return to him the next day to interpret the results of the MRI. The MRI was good, but the employee could not get in to see the doctor until the afternoon of 9/22. By the time this doctor had released him to work, his shift had already ended. Does this count as a lost work day?","No, time missed seeking medical treatment is not counted as days away from work or days of restricted work activity if the employee is otherwise capable of performing all of his or her routine job functions."
An employee was injured with a splinter in his finger and did not report the incident to his supervisor. Then finger became infected because the splinter was never removed. The employee reported the incident 5 days later and the splinter had to be surgically removed. Would this be considered a recordable case?,Yes. It is a work-related injury that resulted in medical treatment beyond first aid. The fact that the employee did not report the incident immediately or seek medical treatment immediately does affect the determination of recordability.
An employee was off of work for 8 days then returned for 4 days on light duty. The doctor then placed him off of work again for 20 more days. Do I count total days out from work or only the second set of days he was out?,You should count 28 days away from work and 4 days of restricted work activity.
"An employee was on restricted duty at the time of discharge. He was not released by his doctor to full duty until sometime after his last day of employment. When counting days of restricted duty, is the count stopped at the last day of employment? Or are we required to count days until the employee was released to full duty by his doctor?","You can stop the day count if your employee leaves your company for reasons unrelated to the injury. If the employee leaves your company due to the injury, you must estimate the number of days the employee would be on restricted work and enter that count as your total. Please be aware that once a total accumulation of days reaches 180, you can cap the day count at that point."
An employee was operating a company vehicle during his normal work hours. The employee became involved in an accident and sustained injuries requiring him to be taken to a hospital. The employee was required to give a urine and blood sample per company rules. Cocaine was found in the employees urine. The employee was fired on the date of the accident for violating the company substance abuse rule. The doctor told the employee that he must not work for at least 1 week. Does that fact that the employee was under the influence of drugs at the time of the injury affect the recordability of the case?,"You must record this case as a column H case with 7 days away. The fact that the employee was under the influence of drugs is not considered in the decision making process. When the employer conducts a drug test based on the occurrence of an accident resulting in an injury at work and subsequently terminates the injured employee, the termination is related to the injury. Therefore, the employer must count the number of days indicated by the doctor that the employee would have been away from work due to the injury and enter that number on the 300 Log."
"An employee was placed on restricted work due to a work related injury for one month. During this one month period, the employee called in sick twice due to non-injury related reasons. Do I count these two absences in my number of ""Restricted Days/Job Transfer"" numbers on my OSHA 300 Form?","Yes. You must count the number of calendar days the employee was restricted as a result of the injury, regardless of whether or not the employee was scheduled to work on those day(s). Weekend days, holidays, vacation days or other days off are included in the total number of days recorded."
"An employee was put on light duty restrictions on December 6th. On December 30th we did not have any work for her under these restrictions. The doctor's notes have her able to work under light duty. Until we are able to find work for her under her restrictions, do we need to count the days she is missing work as days away or restriction days?","You must count the days as days away from work. To count days as restricted days, restricted work activity must be made available to the employee."
"An employee was transported via ambulance following an on the job automobile incident. He was examined at the Emergency Room and was subsequently released without treatment to return to his normal job duties. During transport via ambulance, the paramedics administered a ""routine"" IV of saline as a means to administer medication if needed. Does this administration of saline via IV constitute medical treatment?",An IV put in place solely as a delivery system for medication is not considered medical treatment. Any prescription medication given is considered medical treatment. An IV is considered medical treatment if it is provided to treat an employee's condition such as dehydration or heat stress.
An employee was working from 8:00am - 5:00pm and went home. The next day he reports that he injured his back the day before at work. He is seen and is placed on restricted duty. Is this recordable since he did not report the incident on the shift in which it occurred?,"There is no time limit for reporting an injury or illness to the employer. If the injury is work related and meets the general recording criteria, the case must be recorded."
"An employee went snowmobiling with a customer during lunch. The employee fell off the snowmobile, got injured and is on restricted duty. Since this was a non-business activity and he did it on his own free will (the customer just happened to be with him), should this count as an OSHA recordable injury?","No. Injuries and illnesses occurring outside of the work establishment are only considered work related if the employee is present as a condition of employment or is engaged in a work activity. Because the employee was snowmobiling strictly a personal activity, the case is not work related."
"An employee went to the parking smoking area. He was walking while smoking in the parking area. While getting off the footpath, the employee overlooked a ditch next to foot path. As a result, his right ankle got twisted and he fell down on the road. This resulted in slight abrasion on left knee and left elbow that required medical treatment beyond first aid. Is this considered a personal task under the exemptions to work relationship?","The employee's fall does not meet the work-related exception under 1904.5(b)(2)(v). To meet this exemption, the task must be conducted outside the employee's assigned working hours. Assigned working hours encompass the time between the employee's expected start time of the day and the expected end time of the day, including formal and informal break times. Because the fall occurred during the employee's assigned working hours, the exemption does not apply."
An employee while in the work area and on duty threw a stapler at another employee and struck him in the head. The laceration required a few stitches. Would you consider this a recordable accident?,"Yes. Cases involving workplace violence, horseplay etc. that occur in the work environment are considered to be work related. Since the employee got stitches, medical treatment beyond first aid, the case is recordable."
"An employee who suffers from epilepsy experienced a seizure in the work environment during her assigned working hours and as a consequence , fell and suffered an injury. As a result of the fall she required days away from work. Is the accident recordable?","No. Neither the seizure nor the ensuing injury are recordable. Injuries and illnesses that result solely from non-work-related events or exposures are not recordable under the exception in section 1904.5(b)(2)(ii). Epileptic seizures are a symptom of a disease of non-occupational origin, and the fact that they occur at work does not make them work-related. Because epileptic seizures are not work-related, injuries resulting solely from the seizures are not recordable."
An employee who was given notice of termination and then was hurt on a job site; his time with us was up 10 days after the accident. Do I only record the 10 days or do I have to enter more than that in my records?,"Since the termination of the employee was unrelated to the injury, you need to count 10 days away from work."
An employee who was injured in 2001 had days away from work and restricted work that ran over into 2002. Do I record his days away from work in 2002 onto the 2002 log or do I go back and record it on the 2001 log when the accident actually occurred?,"You must enter the number of calendar days away for the injury or illness on the OSHA 300 Log for the year in which the injury occurred. If the employee is still away from work because of the injury when you prepare the annual summary, estimate the total number of calendar days you expect the employee to be away from work, use this number to calculate the total for the annual summary, and then update the initial log entry later when the day count is known or reaches the 180-day cap."
An employee who was stung by a wasp on the job and was given a prescription allergy shot. Is this recordable on the OSHA Form 300?,Yes. A wasp sting in the work environment is a work-related injury. Administration of a prescription medication makes the case recordable.
"An employee working at an office building slips and falls, suffering an injury that requires medical treatment. The incident occurred in the building lobby that is shared by multiple tenants and is maintained by the building owner. The employee had completed work for the day and left our company offices, taken the elevator down to the lobby, exited the elevator and slipped and fell. Is this work related?",No. Common areas of a shared office building are not considered part of the employer's work environment.
"An employee working with a pneumatic air gun was injured when the mechanical drive on the gun sheared. He was sent to medical, x-rays taken proved negative (no break or fracture to the arm) and was given a prescription for an anti-inflammatory drug to reduce wrist swelling. He was not placed off duty, and decided not to fill the prescription. He returned to work the same day. Is this accident an OSHA recordable injury?","Yes, this is a recordable case. Work-related injuries in which a healthcare professional issues a prescription are recordable, whether that prescription is filled or not."
"An employee works for a certain location and visits different locations of his company during his day's work. During such a visit, he is injured in a location which is other than his home location.  In such a case, should the injury be reported (in the OSHA 300 log) for the home location or the location where the employee was actually injured?","When the injury or illness occurs at one of your establishments, you must record the injury or illness on the OSHA 300 Log of the establishment at which the injury or illness occurred."
"An employee's injury is listed on the 300 log as a work related injury involving restricted work activity. The injury results in more than 180 days of restricted work activity. The days of restricted activity are recorded as 180. Later in the year, this injury requires surgical intervention and results in days away from work. Is it necessary to change the status of this case on the 300 log from days with restricted activity to days away from work?","Yes. The employer must check the box that reflects the most severe outcome associated with a given injury or illness. Since days away from work is a more severe outcome than restricted work the employer is required to remove the check initially placed in the box for job transfer or restriction and enter a check in the box for days away from work (column H). Employers are allowed to cap the number of days away and/or restricted work/job transfer when a case involves 180 calendar days. For purposes of recordability, the employer would enter 180 days in the ""Job transfer or restriction"" column and may also enter 1 day in the ""Days away from work"" column to prevent confusion or computer related problems."
An employee's job profile is lifting/moving boxes up to 20lbs. One day he hurt his back at work. The employee was assigned to folding corner pads for days till his back got rested and was moved to his regular job duties. Is this recordable?,"Yes. This case involves job transfer. You must enter a check mark in column ""I"" and enter 4 days in column L."
"An employer provides a table tennis table/ping pong table in the kitchen for employees to voluntary use on meal breaks. If an employee was to sustain an injury when playing ping pong, would this be classified as non-work related (as it is solely voluntary and is a recreational task)?","The case is not work-related. Under 1904.5(b)(2)(iii), this exception to work-relatedness allows the employer to exclude cases that are related to recreation when they are voluntary and are not being undertaken as a condition of work."
An office employee driving a company vehicle on their normal commute to the office was involved in an accident. If the employee required medical treatment would this have to be recorded?,"Injuries and illnesses that occur during an employee's normal commute, to and from work, are not considered work-related, and therefore not recordable. The fact that the vehicle was a company vehicle is not relevant to determining work relatedness."
"An office employee is driving a company vehicle on their normal commute to the office. When hitting the breaks, the employee was struck by an unsecured object in the vehicle. If the employee requires medical treatment would this have to be recorded?","No. For OSHA recordkeeping purposes, an employee's normal commute from home to office and return would not be considered work-related. Therefore, any injury or illness occurring during this trip would not be recordable. The fact that the vehicle was a company vehicle is not relevant to determining work relatedness."
An office worker falls from a desk because he decides to change the light over it on his own (an activity that is not part of his work). He was taken to the hospital and was given days off work because of lower back pain from the impact. Is this recordable?,"Yes, this case is recordable because it resulted from an event in the work environment and required days away from work. You must consider an injury or illness to be work-related if an event or exposure in the work environment either caused or contributed to the resulting condition, regardless of whether the activity was part of the employee's work or not."
Any employee reported an injury - a broken hand. The employee had punched a wall at work out of frustration. Does this case meet the definition of work related and therefore must be recorded on the OSHA LOG?,"This case is work related and recordable. There is no exception to work-relatedness for acts of violence or horseplay. There is an exception to work relatedness for injuries that are intentionally self inflicted, however it must be shown that the employee intended to hurt his hand when he lost his temper."
"Are ""denied"" claims to be logged on the OSHA 300 log of occupational illnesses and injuries?","Many cases that are recorded in the OSHA system are also compensable under the State workers' compensation system, but many others are not. When an injury or illness occurs to an employee, the employer must independently analyze the case in light of both the OSHA recording criteria and the requirements of the State workers' compensation system to determine whether the case is recordable or compensable, or both. Your case must be judged by the criteria of the OSHA recordkeeping rule to determine if it should be placed on the 300 Log. Workers Compensation is not a consideration of whether the case is OSHA recordable or not."
Are accidents to volunteers and students who are not being paid but are working in a nursing home and under the supervision of the staff required to be logged in?,"If a student or intern is working as an unpaid volunteer, he or she would not be an employee under the OSH Act and an injury or illness of that employee would not be entered into the Part 1904 records. If the worker is receiving compensation for services, then there is an employer-employee relationship for the purposes of OSHA recordkeeping. The employer in that relationship must evaluate any injury or illness at the establishment and enter it into the records if it meets the recording criteria."
Are cases of workplace violence considered work-related under the new Recordkeeping rule?,"The Recordkeeping rule contains no general exception, for purposes of determining work-relationship, for cases involving acts of violence in the work environment. However, some cases involving violent acts might be included within one of the exceptions listed in section 1904.5(b)(2). For example, if an employee arrives at work early to use a company conference room for a civic club meeting and is injured by some violent act, the case would not be work-related under the exception in section 1904.5(b)(2)(v)."
Are electrocardiograms considered medical treatment for recordkeeping purposes?,"Under OSHA's recordkeeping requirements, medical treatment does not include the conduct of diagnostic procedures, such as x-rays, MRIs, and blood tests. An electrocardiogram (EKG of ECG) is a diagnostic procedure and therefore does not constitute medical treatment for OSHA recordkeeping purposes."
"Are injuries and illnesses recordable if they occurred during employment, but were not discovered until after the injured or ill employee was terminated or retired?",These cases are recordable throughout the five year record retention and updating period contained in section 1904.33. The cases would be recorded on either the log of the year in which the injury or illness occurred or the last date of employment.
Are injuries sustained in a fight at the workplace considered work-related?,Yes. An injury or illness must be considered work-related if an event or exposure in the work environment caused or contributed to the injury or illness or significantly aggravated a pre-existing injury or illness. Work relationship is presumed for such injuries and illnesses unless an exception listed in paragraph 1904.5(b)(2) specifically applies. There is no exception for injuries resulting from work-place violence.
"Are sharps/needle stick incidents to be listed on the OSHA 300 Log, even though all such incidents are listed separately on the ""Sharps Log""?","You must record all work-related needlestick injuries and cuts from sharp objects that are contaminated with another person's blood or other potentially infectious material (as defined by 29 CFR 1910.1030). You must enter the case on the OSHA 300 Log as an injury. You may use the 300 Log to meet the requirements of the sharps injury log provided you enter the type and brand of the device causing the sharps injury on the Log and you maintain your records in a way that segregates sharps injuries from other types of work-related injuries and illnesses, or allows sharps injuries to be easily separated."
Are State and local government employers covered by this rule?,"No, but they are covered under the equivalent State rule in States that operate OSHA-approved State Plans. State rules must cover these workplaces and require the recording and reporting of work-related injuries and illnesses."
"Are surgical glues used to treat lacerations considered ""first aid?""","No, surgical glue is a wound closing device. All wound closing devices except for butterfly and steri strips are by definition ""medical treatment,"" because they are not included on the first aid list."
Are the electronic reporting requirements based on the size of the establishment or the size of the firm?,"The electronic reporting requirements are based on the size of the establishment, not the firm. The OSHA injury and illness records are maintained at the establishment level. An establishment is defined as a single physical location where business is conducted or where services or industrial operations are performed. A firm may be comprised of one or more establishments. To determine if you need to provide OSHA with the required data for an establishment, you need to determine the establishment's peak employment during the last calendar year. Each individual employed in the establishment at any time during the calendar year counts as one employee, including full-time, part-time, seasonal, and temporary workers. All establishments with 250 or more employees in industries covered by the recordkeeping regulation must electronically submit to OSHA injury and illness information from OSHA Forms 300, 300A, and 301. Establishments with 20-249 employees in certain industries must electronically submit information from OSHA Form 300A only."
"Are the worker's compensation first report of injury form and the OSHA Form 301 both required to be filled out, or will just the worker's compensation form be sufficient for compliance?","The worker's compensation form is sufficient if it is equivalent to the OSHA 301 form. An equivalent form is one that has the same information, is as readable and understandable, and is completed using the same instructions as the OSHA form it replaces. Many employers use an insurance form instead of the OSHA 301 Incident Report, or supplement an insurance form by adding any additional information required by OSHA."
Are there any OSHA regulations on what OSHA 300 Log information our company gives to our customers when they request our health and safety information?,"If you decide to voluntarily disclose the Forms to persons other than government representatives, employees, former employees or authorized representatives you must remove or hide the employees' names and other personally identifying information."
Are there any special rules for determining whether a hearing loss case is work-related?,"No. You must use the rules in § 1904.5 to determine if the hearing loss is work-related. If an event or exposure in the work environment either caused or contributed to the hearing loss, or significantly aggravated a pre-existing hearing loss, you must consider the case to be work related."
Are there situations where I do not put the employee's name on the forms for privacy reasons?,"Yes, if you have a ""privacy concern case,"" you may not enter the employee's name on the OSHA 300 Log. Instead, enter ""privacy case"" in the space normally used for the employee's name. This will protect the privacy of the injured or ill employee when another employee, a former employee, or an authorized employee representative is provided access to the OSHA 300 Log under § 1904.35(b)(2). You must keep a separate, confidential list of the case numbers and employee names for your privacy concern cases so you can update the cases and provide the information to the government if asked to do so:"
Are tick/insect bites to be recorded on the OHSA log?,"Insect and animal bites that occur within the work environment are work-related injuries. If the injury requires medical treatment beyond first aid, days away from work, restricted work activity or job transfer, the case is recordable."
Are transfers to another job recorded in the same way as restricted work cases?,"Yes, both job transfer and restricted work cases are recorded in the same box on the OSHA 300 Log. For example, if you assign, or a physician or other licensed health care professional recommends that you assign, an injured or ill worker to his or her routine job duties for part of the day and to another job for the rest of the day, the injury or illness involves a job transfer. You must record an injury or illness that involves a job transfer by placing a check in the box for the job transfer."
Are we responsible to record injuries occurring from an auto accident when the employee is on their way to or from work?,You are not required to record injuries from an auto accident when the employee is commuting to or from work.
Are welding flash burns considered a recordable?,"A welding flash burn is recordable if it involves one or more of the following: medical treatment beyond first aid, restricted work activity; job transfer; or days away from work."
Are work-related cases involving chipped or broken teeth recordable?,"Yes, under section 1904.7(b)(7), these cases are considered a significant injury or illness when diagnosed by a physician or other health care professional. As discussed in the preamble of the final rule, work-related fractures of bones or teeth are recognized as constituting significant diagnoses and, if the condition is work-related, are appropriately recorded at the time of initial diagnosis even if the case does not involve any of the other general recording criteria."
As a construction company we may have as many as 30 different job sites during a calendar year. Do I need to complete a separate 300 and 300A form for each?,"No. If you have short-term establishments (i.e., establishments that will exist for less than a year) you do have to maintain a 300 log, however, you do not have to keep a separate OSHA 300 Log for each such establishment. You may keep one OSHA 300 Log that covers all of your short-term establishments."
Can a completed First Notice of Injury form be used as a substitute for the OSHA Form 301?,"An equivalent form is one that has the same information, is as readable and understandable, and is completed using the same instructions as the OSHA form it replaces. Many employers use an insurance form instead of the OSHA 301 Incident Report, or supplement an insurance form by adding any additional information required by OSHA."
"Can an employer use a 3rd party (e.g. insurance company, accountant, private safety consultant) to complete and maintain the OSHA 300 log?","Employers may use 3rd parties to complete their injury and illness forms, but the employer is responsible for the content and accuracy of the forms. A company executive must certify that he or she has examined the OSHA 300 Log and that he or she reasonably believes, based on his or her knowledge of the process by which the information was recorded, that the annual summary is correct and complete."
"Can an employer who has fixed locations in most of the states in the continental United States retain Form 301 in a ""central location"" (like their main office) and just post a notice at the site indicating where these forms are being stored?","Yes, you may keep the records for an establishment at your headquarters or other central location if you can: (i) Transmit information about the injuries and illnesses from the establishment to the central location within seven (7) calendar days of receiving information that a recordable injury or illness has occurred; and (ii) Produce and send the records from the central location to the establishment within the time frames required by Section 1904.35 and Section 1904.40 when you are required to provide records to a government representative, employees, former employees or employee representatives."
Can I use the OSHA 300 Log to meet the Bloodborne Pathogen Standard's requirement for a sharps injury log?,"Yes. You may use the 300 Log to meet the requirements of the sharps injury log provided you enter the type and brand of the device causing the sharps injury on the Log and you maintain your records in a way that segregates sharps injuries from other types of work-related injuries and illnesses, or allows sharps injuries to be easily separated."
Can OSHA Summary Form 300A be posted electronically (on our intranet website) to satisfy the Feb 1-Apr 30 posting requirement?,No. A paper copy of the Form 300A must be posted in a conspicuous place or places where notices to employees are customarily posted.

Can the OSHA Log 300 & Summary 300A be replicated by our IT department to create a similar but perhaps slightly different looking form as long as all of the same information remains on it?,"Yes. An equivalent form is one that has the same information, is as readable and understandable, and is completed using the same instructions as the OSHA form it replaces."
Can we classify an incident as not work related because the employee didn't report it until several weeks later?,Timely reporting is not a criterion for deciding work-relationship. If an event or exposure in the work environment either caused or contributed to the resulting condition or significantly aggravated a pre-existing injury or illness it is considered work related regardless of being reported several weeks later.
Can you clarify the relationship between the OSHA recordkeeping requirements and the requirements in the Bloodborne Pathogens standard to maintain a sharps injury log?,"The OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Standard states: ""The requirement to establish and maintain a sharps injury log shall apply to any employer who is required to maintain a log of occupational injuries and illnesses under 29 CFR 1904."" Therefore, if an employer is exempted from the OSHA recordkeeping rule, the employer does not have to maintain a sharps log. For example, dentists' offices and doctors' offices are not required to keep a sharps log after January 1, 2002."

Do I have to record a case where I voluntarily removed the employee from exposure before the medical removal criteria in an OSHA standard are met?,"No, if the case involves voluntary medical removal before the medical removal levels required by an OSHA standard, you do not need to record the case on the OSHA 300 Log."
Do I have to record restricted work or job transfer if it applies only to the day on which the injury occurred or the illness began?,"No, you do not have to record restricted work or job transfers if you, or the physician or another licensed health care professional, impose the restriction or transfer only for the day on which the injury occurred or the illness began."
Do I have to record the hearing loss if I am going to retest the employee's hearing?,"No, if you retest the employee's hearing within 30 days of the first test, and the retest does not confirm the recordable STS, you are not required to record the hearing loss case on the OSHA 300 Log. If the retest confirms the recordable STS, you must record the hearing loss illness within seven (7) calendar days of the retest. If subsequent audiometric testing performed under the testing requirements of the § 1910.95 noise standard indicates that an STS is not persistent, you may erase or line-out the recorded entry."

If the motor vehicle accident occurred on a public street or highway, but not in a construction work zone, you do not have to report the fatality, inpatient hospitalization, amputation, or loss of an eye to OSHA. However, the fatality, in-patient hospitalization, amputation, or loss of an eye must be recorded on your OSHA injury and illness records, if you are required to keep such records."
Do I have to respond to a BLS survey form if I am normally exempt from keeping OSHA injury and illness records?,"Yes, even if you are exempt from keeping injury and illness records under § 1904.1 to § 1904.3, the BLS may inform you in writing that it will be collecting injury and illness information from you in the coming year. If you receive such a letter, you must keep the injury and illness records required by § 1904.5 to § 1904.15 and make a survey report for the year covered by the survey."

Do I have to update the OSHA 300 Log during the five-year storage period?,"Yes, during the storage period, you must update your stored OSHA 300 Logs to include newly discovered recordable injuries or illnesses and to show any changes that have occurred in the classification of previously recorded injuries and illnesses. If the description or outcome of a case changes, you must remove or line out the original entry and enter the new information"
Do I have to update the OSHA 301 Incident Reports?,"No, you are not required to update the OSHA 301 Incident Reports, but you may do so if you wish."
Do I need special software to electronically submit the data to OSHA?,No. OSHA has provided a secure website for the electronic submission of information. The website includes web forms for direct data entry and instructions for other means of submission (e.g. file uploads).
"Do I need to keep OSHA injury and illness records for short-term establishments (i.e., establishments that will exist for less than a year)?","Yes, however, you do not have to keep a separate OSHA 300 Log for each such establishment. You may keep one OSHA 300 Log that covers all of your short-term establishments. You may also include the short-term establishments' recordable injuries and illnesses on an OSHA 300 Log that covers short-term establishments for individual company divisions or geographic regions."
Do I need to record a contractor injury on my company's 300 log or does the contractor company record it on their 300 logs?,"You must record the recordable injuries and illnesses that occur to employees who are not on your payroll if you supervise these employees on a day-to-day basis. If the contractor's employee is under the day-to-day supervision of the contractor, the contractor is responsible for recording the injury or illness. If you supervise the contractor employee's work on a day-to-day basis, you must record the injury or illness."
Do I need to submit the OSHA 300/300A form to you or just keep the 300A posted from Feb 1 - April 30?

Do mining incidents that fall under MSHA need to appear on OSHA 300 log for the company?,"No, if you create records to comply with MSHA's injury and illness recordkeeping requirements, OSHA will consider those records as meeting OSHA's Part 1904 recordkeeping requirements."
"Do part-time, seasonal, or temporary workers count as employees in the criteria for number of employees in paragraph (a) of this section (1904.41)?","Yes, each individual employed in the establishment at any time during the calendar year counts as one employee, including full-time, part-time, seasonal, and temporary workers."
Do States with OSHA-approved State plans have the same industry exemptions as Federal OSHA?,"States with OSHA-approved plans may require employers to keep records for the State, even though those employers are within an industry exempted by the Federal rule."
Do the case numbers on the log have to be sequential?,No. The employer may use any numbering system they choose. The only requirement is that each case number on the log is unique.
Do the OSHA 300 and 300A records need to be sent to OSHA?,"Keep these records on file at your establishment for the 5 year retention period. Beginning in 2017, some employers will be required to submit information from their forms to OSHA. Seewww.osha.gov/injuryreporting/index.htmlfor further information."
Do we need to keep a log in establishments that have 10 or fewer employees? The company itself has more than 10 employees.,Each separate establishment in existence a year or more is to have it's own OSHA 300 log regardless of the number of employees working at that establishment. The partial exemption for size is based on the number of employees in the entire company.
Do we need to record injuries caused due to sole negligence of third parties on work site?,"Employer, employee, or third party fault is not a criterion for deciding work-relationship. You must consider an injury or illness to be work-related if an event or exposure in the work environment either caused or contributed to the resulting condition or significantly aggravated a pre-existing injury or illness. Work-relatedness is presumed for injuries and illnesses resulting from events or exposures occurring in the work environment, unless an exception in § 1904.5(b)(2) specifically applies."
Do we record cases if first aid is conducted in the emergency room at the local hospital (such as cleaning or wrapping a cut with no stitches)?,"No, OSHA considers the treatments listed on the first aid list to be first aid regardless of the professional status of the person providing the treatment. Even when these treatments are provided by a physician or other licensed health care professional, they are considered first aid for the purposes of Part 1904."
Do x-rays make a case recordable?,No. X-rays and other diagnostic procedures are not considered medical treatment and do not make a case recordable.
"Does ""Total hours worked by all employees last year"" include holiday, sick, and bereavement leave?","No, you do not include vacation, sick leave, holidays, or any other non-work time, even if the employees were paid for it.  Include hours worked by salaried, hourly, part-time and seasonal workers, as well as hours worked by other workers subject to day to day supervision by your establishment (e.g., temporary help services workers)."
Does an employee report of an injury or illness establish the existence of the injury or illness for recordkeeping purposes?,"No. In determining whether a case is recordable, the employer must first decide whether an injury or illness, as defined by the rule, has occurred. If the employer is uncertain about whether an injury or illness has occurred, the employer may refer the employee to a physician or other health care professional for evaluation and may consider the health care professional's opinion in determining whether an injury or illness exists. [Note: If a physician or other licensed health care professional diagnoses a significant injury or illness within the meaning of §1904.7(b)(7) and the employer determines that the case is work-related, the case must be recorded.]"
Does every employer have to routinely submit information from the injury and illness records to OSHA?,"No, only two categories of employers must routinely submit information from their injury and illness records. First, if your establishment had 250 or more employees at any time during the previous calendar year, and this part requires your establishment to keep records, then you must submit the required Form 300A, 300, and 301 information to OSHA once a year. Second, if your establishment had 20 or more employees but fewer than 250 employees at any time during the previous calendar year, and your establishment is classified in an industry listed in appendix A to subpart E of this part, then you must submit the required Form 300A information to OSHA once a year. Employers in these two categories must submit the required information by the date listed in paragraph (c) of this section of the year after the calendar year covered by the form or forms (for example, 2017 for the 2016 forms). If you are not in either of these two categories, then you must submit information from the injury and illness records to OSHA only if OSHA notifies you to do so for an individual data collection."
Does every employer have to send data to the BLS?,"No, each year, the BLS sends injury and illness survey forms to randomly selected employers and uses the information to create the Nation's occupational injury and illness statistics. In any year, some employers will receive a BLS survey form and others will not. You do not have to send injury and illness data to the BLS unless you receive a survey form."
Does loss of an eye include loss of sight?,"No. Loss of sight without the physical removal of the eye is not reportable under the requirements of section 1904.39. However, a case involving loss of sight that results in the in-patient hospitalization of the worker within 24 hours of the work-related incident is reportable."
Does OSHA have a complete list of Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes in Excel format available on its web site?,"No. However, an Excel file containing the 1987 SIC codes is available on the Census' web site athttps://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/concordances/concordances.html"
"Does OSHA require a separate record, other than on the 300 form, for needle sticks and exposures?",The employer can use the OSHA 300 to meet the bloodborne standard requirements as long as you provide the type and brand of the device causing the sharps injury on the log.
Does the 180 day cap include both lost work days and restricted days or should each be capped at 180 days?,You may stop counting days away from work and days of restricted work activity once the combination of both reaches 180 days.
"Does the administration of oxygen in a hospital or by an EMT as a result of inhalation of smoke at the workplace during an accident count as medical treatment and, thus, OSHA recordable?","Yes. If the employee exposed to the smoke exhibits symptoms of an injury or illness, such as respiratory distress, the administration of oxygen makes the case recordable."
Does the diagnosis by a physician of a chipped bone constitute a recordable injury as is a fractured bone?,Yes. Diagnosis of a work-related chipped bone is considered a significant injury and is a recordable case.
Does the employer decide if an injury or illness is a privacy concern case?,"Yes. The employer must decide if a case is a privacy concern case, using 1904.29(b)(7), which lists the six types of injuries and illnesses the employer must consider privacy concern cases. If the case meets any of these criteria, the employer must consider it a privacy concern case. This is a complete list of all injury and illnesses considered privacy concern cases."
"Does the employer have to record a work-related injury and illness, if an employee experiences minor musculoskeletal discomfort, the health care professional determines that the employee is fully able to perform all of his or her routine job functions, but the employer assigns a work restriction to the injured employee?","As set out in Chapter 2, I., F. of the Recordkeeping Policies and Procedures Manual (CPL 2-0.131) a case would not be recorded under section 1904.7(b)(4) if 1) the employee experiences minor musculoskeletal discomfort, and 2) a health care professional determines that the employee is fully able to perform all of his or her routine job functions, and 3) the employer assigns a work restriction to that employee for the purpose of preventing a more serious condition from developing. If a case is or becomes recordable under any other general recording criteria contained in section 1904.7, such as medical treatment beyond first aid, a case involving minor musculoskeletal discomfort would be recordable."
"Does the form 300A need to be mailed to OSHA by a certain date? If so, when is this date? Where should it be mailed to?","Keep the form on file at your establishment for the 5 year retention period. Beginning in 2017, some employers will be required to submit information from their forms to OSHA. Seewww.osha.gov/injuryreporting/index.htmlfor further information."
Does the OSHA 300 log fall under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to keep patient's medical information private and confidential?,No. Please seehttp://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=INTERPRET…for a detailed discussion.
Does the OSHA Form 300A Summary page that was posted need to be submitted to OSHA directly as well as posted?,"Keep the form on file at your establishment for the 5 year retention period. Beginning in 2017, some employers will be required to submit information from their forms to OSHA. Seewww.osha.gov/injuryreporting/index.htmlfor further information."
Does the professional status of the person providing the treatment have any effect on what is considered first aid or medical treatment?,"No, OSHA considers the treatments listed in § 1904.7(b)(5)(ii) of this Part to be first aid regardless of the professional status of the person providing the treatment. Even when these treatments are provided by a physician or other licensed health care professional, they are considered first aid for the purposes of Part 1904. Similarly, OSHA considers treatment beyond first aid to be medical treatment even when it is provided by someone other than a physician or other licensed health care professional"
"Does the repair of a crown on a person's tooth qualify as ""medical treatment"" for recordkeeping purposes?","If an employee chips or breaks a crown, it is a recordable case if it results in any of the following: medical treatment beyond first aid; restricted work activity; job transfer; loss of consciousness; or days away from work. Repair of the crown itself is not considered medical treatment. However, if the employee requires prescription medications during the repair, the case would be recordable."
Does the rule allow an employer to have an employee incentive program?,"This rule does not prohibit incentive programs. However, employers must not create incentive programs that deter or discourage an employee from reporting an injury or illness. Incentive programs should encourage safe work practices and promote worker participation in safety-related activities."
Does the size or degree of a burn determine recordability?,"No, the size or degree of a work-related burn does not determine recordability. If a work-related first, second, or third degree burn results in one or more of the outcomes in section 1904.7 (days away, work restrictions, medical treatment, etc.), the case must be recorded."
Does the use of a TENS device constitute medical treatment for record keeping purposes?,Treatments listed under 1904.7(b)(5)(ii) is a complete list of treatments considered first aid for recordkeeping purposes. Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) does not fit in any of the treatment categories of the first aid list and is considered medical treatment for recordkeeping purposes.
Does the use of Dermabond in repairing a laceration make it a recordable injury?,"Yes, surgical glues, like Dermabond are considered medical treatment. Steri strips and butterfly bandages are the only wound closures considered first aid."
"Does this mean that I must record all cuts, lacerations, punctures, and scratches?","No, you need to record cuts, lacerations, punctures, and scratches only if they are work-related and involve contamination with another person's blood or other potentially infectious material. If the cut laceration, or scratch involves a clean object, or a contaminant other than blood or other potentially infectious material, you need to record the case only if it meets one or more of the recording criteria in 1904.7."
Does using a magnet to remove metallic particles from the eye constitute medical treatment?,"Yes, using a magnet to remove metallic particles from the eye constitutes medical treatment."
"Employee X is injured when he is stung by a bee at work, and he reports the injury to Employer. Employer disciplines Employee X for violating a work rule requiring employees to ""maintain situational awareness."" Employer only enforces the rule when employees get hurt. Did Employer violate 1904.35(b)(1)(iv) by disciplining Employee X for reporting a bee sting injury?","Yes. This is an example of a pretextual disciplinary action, which is prohibited. In this case, although Employer ostensibly disciplined Employee X for violating a work rule, Employer only enforced the work rule after a work-related injury or illness report, which indicates that the real reason for the discipline was the reported injury, not the rule violation. Such vague work rules are particularly susceptible to being enforced disproportionately against employees who report work-related injuries or illnesses because they do not require or proscribe specific conduct."
"Employee X reports a hand injury that she sustained while operating a saw after bypassing the guard on the saw, contrary to the employer's work rule. Employee X's hand injury required her to miss work for two days. Employer disciplined Employee X for bypassing the guard contrary to its instructions. Employer regularly monitors its workforce for safety rule violations and disciplines employees who bypass machine guards regardless of whether they report injuries. Did Employer violate 1904.35(b)(1)(iv) when it disciplined Employee X?","No. Section 1904.35(b)(1)(iv) does not prohibit employers from disciplining employees who violate legitimate workplace safety rules as long as the rules are not used as a pretext for retaliating against employees who report work-related injuries or illnesses. On the contrary, OSHA encourages employers to implement workplace safety rules, train employees on those rules, and take consistent, appropriate action when employees violate them regardless of whether the employees violating the rules reported injuries."
"Employee X twists her ankle at work but does not immediately realize that she is injured because her ankle is not painful or swollen, and therefore she does not report the injury to Employer. The next morning, Employee X's ankle is painful and swollen and she realizes it is the kind of injury she is required to report to Employer as soon as practicable. However, Employee X does not report the injury after this realization, although she easily could have, and instead reports it several weeks later. Employer disciplines Employee X for failing to report her injury as soon as practicable after realizing she has the kind of injury she is required to report. Did Employer violate 1904.35(b)(1)(iv) by disciplining Employee X for failing to report a work-related injury or illness as soon as practicable after realizing she had a work-related injury?",No. OSHA recognizes that employers have a legitimate business interest in learning about employee injuries close in time to when they occur or become manifest. Employers may require employees to report work-related injuries or illnesses as soon as practicable after they realize they have a work-related injury serious enough to report. Note: a reporting procedure that requires employees to report as soon as practicable after they realize they have the kind of injury or illness they are required to report is reasonable and therefore would also not violate section 1904.35(b)(1)(i).
"Employee X twists his ankle at work but does not immediately realize that he is injured because his ankle is not sore or swollen, and therefore he does not report the injury to Employer. The next morning, Employee X's ankle is sore and swollen, and he realizes he has the kind of injury he is required to report to Employer. He reports the injury to the employer that day. Employer disciplines Employee X for failing to report his injury ""immediately"" as required by Employer's X's injury reporting rules. Did Employer violate 1904.35(b)(1)(iv) by disciplining Employee X for failing to report his injury immediately even though Employee X did not immediately realize he was injured?","Yes. Employer's rigid prompt reporting requirement would violate section 1904.35(b)(1)(i) because it fails to account for injuries that build up over time. In addition, taking adverse action against an employee under such a policy as described in this example would also constitute a pretextual disciplinary action, which is prohibited under section 1904.35(b)(1)(iv). In this case, although Employer ostensibly took the adverse action because Employee X violated a work rule, the work rule was not reasonable and therefore does not constitute a legitimate business reason for taking adverse action against an employee who reports a work-related injury or illness. Although employers may require employees to report as soon as practicable after realizing they have a work-related injury or illness, it is not practicable for an employee to report an injury that has not yet manifested."
"Employee X was injured when he inadvertently drove a forklift into a piece of stationary equipment, and he reported the injury to Employer. Employer required Employee X to take a drug test. Did Employer violate section 1904.35(b)(1)(iv) for drug testing Employee X?","No. Because Employee X's conduct-the manner in which he operated the forklift-contributed to his injury, and because drug use can affect conduct, it was objectively reasonable to require Employee X to take a drug test after Employer learned of his injury. Drug testing an employee who engaged in conduct that caused an injury is objectively reasonable because conduct can be affected by drug use."
"Employer drug tests all employees who report work-related injuries to the employer to get a 5% reduction in its workers' compensation premiums under the state's voluntary Drug-Free Workplace program. Employer drug tests Employee X when she reports a work-related injury that could not reasonably have been caused by drug use, such as a bee sting or carpal tunnel syndrome. Did Employer violate section 1904.35(b)(1)(iv) by drug testing Employee X?","No. Drug testing conducted pursuant to a state workers' compensation law, whether voluntary or mandatory, is not affected by section 1904.35(b)(1)(iv)."
"Employer holds a party for all employees who complete a safety training course. Employee X failed to attend the training because she was absent from work due to a work-related injury that she reported. Employer excluded Employee X from the training-completion party because she did not complete the training. Employer consistently excluded all employees who failed to complete a training course from the training-completion party regardless of why they failed to complete the training, including those who were on vacation or absent because of a non-work-related injury or illness. Did Employer violate 1904.35(b)(1)(iv) by excluding Employee X from the party?","No. In this case Employer excluded Employee X from the party because Employee X did not complete the safety training, not simply because Employee X reported a work-related injury. OSHA encourages employers to celebrate workplace safety achievements such as completing safety training and complying with legitimate workplace safety rules."
"Employer informs its employees that it will hold a substantial cash prize drawing for each work group at the end of each month in which all members of the work group comply with applicable safety rules, such as wearing required fall protection. Employee X sustains a lost-time injury when he falls from a platform while not wearing required fall protection, and he reports the injury to Employer. Employer cancels the cash prize drawing for Employee X's work group that month because Employee X failed to wear required fall protection. Employer actively monitors its workforce for compliance with applicable work rules and cancels the cash prize drawings when it discovers work rule violations regardless of whether the employee who violated the work rule also reported an injury. Did Employer violate 1904.35(b)(1)(iv) when it cancelled the cash prize drawing for Employee X's work group because Employee X failed to wear required fall protection?","No. In this case, Employer cancelled the cash prize drawing because Employee X violated a legitimate work rule, not because he reported a work-related injury. OSHA encourages employers to enforce legitimate workplace safety rules by monitoring for compliance with those rules and taking consistent, appropriate corrective action when violations occur whether or not the employee who violated the rule also reported an injury."
"Employer informs its employees that it will hold a substantial cash prize drawing for each work group at the end of each month in which all members of the work group comply with applicable safety rules, such as wearing required fall protection. Employee X sustains a lost-time injury when he falls from a platform while not wearing required fall protection. Employer cancels the cash prize drawing for Employee X's work group that month ostensibly because Employee X failed to wear required fall protection. However, Employer's employees routinely fail to wear required fall protection but the only time Employer cancels the cash prize drawing is when an employee reports an injury. Did Employer violate 1904.35(b)(1)(iv) when it cancelled the cash prize drawing for Employee X's work group because Employee X failed to wear required fall protection?","Yes. This is an example of a pretextual disciplinary action, which is prohibited. Although Employer ostensibly took the adverse action because Employee X violated a legitimate work rule, Employer failed to take the same action when other employees violated the same work rule without reporting an injury. Employer treated employees who engaged in the same unsafe conduct differently based on whether they reported an injury to the employer, which indicates that the real reason Employer took the adverse action against Employee X was because of the injury report, not because of the work rule violation."
Employer informs its employees that it will hold a substantial cash prize drawing for each work group at the end of each month in which no employee in the work group sustains a lost-time injury. Employee X reports an injury that she sustained while operating a mechanical power press. Employee X did not violate any employer safety rules when she sustained her injury. Employee X's injury requires her to miss work for two days. Employer cancels the cash prize drawing for that month for Employee X's work group because of Employee X's lost-time injury. Did Employer violate 1904.35(b)(1)(iv) when it cancelled the cash prize drawing for Employee X's work group because of a lost-time injury that was sustained while Employee X was following the employer's work rules?,"Yes. Cancelling a substantial cash prize drawing solely because an employee was injured and reported the injury, without regard to the circumstances surrounding the injury, would likely violate section 1904.35(b)(1)(iv). In this case, the employer retaliated against the employee (by cancelling a substantial cash prize drawing) because the employee engaged in protected activity (reporting her injury to the employer). This type of activity may also discourage reporting because a worker may feel pressure from coworkers not to cancel the drawing, or may be reluctant to report out of loyalty to those coworkers."
"Employer required Employee X to take a drug test after Employee X reported work-related carpal tunnel syndrome. Employer had no reasonable basis for suspecting that drug use could have contributed to her condition, and it had no other reasonable basis for requiring her to take a drug test. Rather, Employer routinely subjects all employees who report work-related injuries to a drug test regardless of the circumstances surrounding the injury. The state workers' compensation program applicable to Employer did not address drug testing, and no other state or federal law requires Employer to drug test employees who sustain injuries at work. Did Employer violate section 1904.35(b)(1)(iv) by subjecting Employee X to a drug test simply because she reported a work-related injury?","Yes. Section 1904.35(b)(1)(iv) prohibits an employer from taking adverse action against employees simply because they report work-related injuries. Rather, employers must have a legitimate business reason for requiring a drug test, such as a reasonable belief that drug use contributed to the injury. If drug use could not reasonably have contributed to a particular injury and the employer has no other reasonable basis for requiring a drug test, section 1904.35(b)(1)(iv) prohibits the employer from drug testing employees simply because they report injuries unless the drug test is conducted pursuant to a state workers' compensation law or other state or federal law."
"Employer requires all employees who report lost-time injuries to take a drug test because the employer's private insurance carrier provides discounted rates to employers that implement such a drug-testing policy. The relevant rate discount provisions in the private policy are identical to those in the applicable state workers' compensation law. Employer drug tests Employee X when she reports a lost-time injury that could not reasonably have been caused by drug use, such as a bee sting or carpal tunnel syndrome. Would OSHA cite Employer for violating section 1904.35(b)(1)(iv) in these circumstances by drug testing Employee X to secure lower private insurance premiums?","No. To maintain consistency between public and private worker's compensation coverage in the same state, OSHA will not cite employers under section 1904.35(b)(1)(iv) who conduct post-accident drug testing under private party policies that mirror the applicable state workers' compensation law."
"Employer requires all employees who report lost-time injuries to take a drug test regardless of whether drug use could have contributed to the injury because the drug testing requirement is included in the collective bargaining agreement at the workplace. Employer drug tests Employee X (who is covered by the collective bargaining agreement) when she reports a lost-time injury that could not reasonably have been caused by drug use, such as a bee sting or carpal tunnel syndrome. The employer had no reasonable basis for suspecting that drug use could have contributed to her injury and had no other reasonable basis for requiring the test. Did Employer violate section 1904.35(b)(1)(iv) by drug testing Employee X pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement?","Yes. Section 1904.35(b)(1)(iv) prohibits an employer from taking adverse action against employees simply because they report work-related injuries absent a reasonable belief that drug use could have contributed to the injury or another reasonable basis for requiring a drug test. Although OSHA does not intend for section 1904.35(b)(1)(iv) to supersede other state or federal programs addressing post-injury drug testing of employees, collective bargaining agreements may not supersede section 1904.35(b)(1)(iv)."
Employers must record injuries and illnesses that occur to employees who are not on their payroll if they supervise these employees on a day-to-day basis. Define supervising work on a day-to-day basis.,"The host employer must record the recordable injuries and illnesses of employees not on its payroll if it supervises them on a day to day basis. Day to day supervision occurs when ""in addition to specifying the output, product or result to be accomplished by the person's work, the employer supervises the details, means, methods and processes by which the work is to be accomplished."""
"For medications that have both prescription and non-prescription strengths, how to I determine what level is first aid and what level is medical treatment?",OSHA considers over-the-counter medication to be at non-prescription strength as it is described on the label of the medication. A dosage greater than that described on the over-the-counter medication label is considered prescription strength and medical treatment for OSHA recordkeeping purposes.
"For the 10 employees or less recordkeeping exemption, what is the criteria for distinguishing between an individual business establishment that is part of a larger company, and a completely unique company? If a business establishment is separately incorporated, is that adequate to demonstrate a separate and unique company?","Yes, a separately incorporated business is evaluated as a unique company when determining firm size under Part 1904.1."
"From time to time, emergency department employees encounter patients with suspected meningitis. As a result, the employee receives a prescription to reduce their chances of contracting meningitis. If the employee receives a prescription of antibiotics as a precaution and the final tests from the patient indicate no meningitis exposure, is this example a recordable illness?","No. To be recordable on the OSHA log an injury or illness must exist. Exposures without signs or symptoms of the illness are not recordable, even if medical treatment is administered."
How can I find out if my State has an OSHA-approved plan?,"The following States have OSHA-approved plans: Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wyoming. Connecticut, New Jersey, Illinois, Maine, the Virgin Islands and New York have plans that cover State and local government employees only."
"How do I calculate my recordable incidence rate if I have under 100 employees? Currently I take the number of incidence X 200,000 divided by Hours worked. Could I divide the 200,000 by the actual number of employees to ensure that I don't get a falsely bloated incidence rate?","The 200,000 hours in the formula represents the equivalent of 100 employees working 40 hours per week, 50 weeks per year, and provides the standard base for the incidence rates. This constant is used to calculate incidence rates per 100 FTE to show the relative level of injuries and illnesses among firms of different employment size groups. In other words, the constant divided by the Hours Worked figure normalizes your firm size so comparisons can be made. This holds true for establishments with less than 100 workers as well as establishment with more than 100 workers. You should not change the constant if you are going to compare your establishment incidence rate to the BLS industry rates."
"How do I calculate the ""total hours worked"" on my annual summary when I have both hourly and temporary workers?","To calculate the total hours worked by all employees, include the hours worked by salaried, hourly, part-time and seasonal workers, as well as hours worked by other workers you supervise (e.g., workers supplied by a temporary help service). Do not include vacation, sick leave, holidays, or any other non-work time even if employees were paid for it. If your establishment keeps records of only the hours paid or if you have employees who are not paid by the hour, you must estimate the hours that the employees actually worked."
How do I certify the annual summary?,"A company executive must certify that he or she has examined the OSHA 300 Log and that he or she reasonably believes, based on his or her knowledge of the process by which the information was recorded, that the annual summary is correct and complete."
How do I classify medical removal cases on the OSHA 300 Log?,"You must enter each medical removal case on the OSHA 300 Log as either a case involving days away from work or a case involving restricted work activity, depending on how you decide to comply with the medical removal requirement. If the medical removal is the result of a chemical exposure, you must enter the case on the OSHA 300 Log by checking the ""poisoning"" column."
"How do I count days away from work for an employee who works on an as-needed/as available basis? She has been incapacitated due to on-the-job injury since mid-September, which totals approximately eighty calendar days. However, had she been able to work, the employee would probably have worked only about ten days.","You must count the number of calendar days the employee is unable to work, regardless of schedule. In this case, enter 80 days."
How do I count days of job transfer or restriction?,"You count days of job transfer or restriction in the same way you count days away from work, using 1904.7(b)(3)(1) to (viii), above. The only difference is that, if you permanently assign the injured or ill employee to a job that has been modified or permanently changed in a manner that eliminates the routine functions the employee was restricted from performing, you may stop the day count when the modification or change is made permanent. You must count at least one day of restricted work or job transfer for such cases."
How do I count lost time days for a part time employee. We have a part time worker (2-4 days / week) who is injured and will miss some work. Do we count by straight calendar days? Or do we count by the number of days the part time worker was scheduled to work and could not work because of the injury?,"You must count the number of calendar days, regardless of whether the employee was scheduled to work on those days."
"How do I count the number of days an employee was off work due to a workplace injury when the employee works on a part-time, as-needed basis?","You must count the number of calendar days the employee was unable to work as a result of the injury or illness, regardless of whether or not the employee was scheduled to work on those day(s). This applies to employees who work on a part-time or as needed basis as well as to full time employees. You may end the count of days away from work when the employee is capable to return."
"How do I count weekends, holidays, or other days the employee would not have worked anyway?","You must count the number of calendar days the employee was unable to work as a result of the injury or illness, regardless of whether or not the employee was scheduled to work on those day(s). Weekends days, holidays, vacation days or other days off are included in the total number of days recorded if the employee would not have been able to work on those days because of work-related injury and illness."
How do I decide if a case is work-related when the employee is working at home?,"Injuries and illnesses that occur while an employee is working at home, including work in a home office, will be considered work-related if the injury or illness occurs while the employee is performing work for pay or compensation in the home, and the injury or illness is directly related to the performance of work rather than to the general home environment or setting. For example, if an employee drops a of work documents and injures his or foot, the case is considered work-related. If an employer's fingernail is punctured by a needle from a sewing machine used to perform garment work at home, becomes infected and requires medical treatment, the injury is considered work-related. If an employee is injured because he or she trips on the family dog while rushing to answer a work phone call, the case is not considered work-related. If an employee working at home is electrocuted because of faulty home wiring, the injury is not considered work-related."
How do I decide if an injury or illness involved a transfer to another job?,"If you assign an injured or ill employee to a job other than his or her regular job for part of the day, the case involves transfer to another job. Note: This does not include the day on which the injury or illness occurred."
How do I decide if the injury or illness resulted in restricted work?,"Restricted work occurs when, as the result of a work-related injury or illness: You keep the employee from performing one or more of the routine functions of his or her job, or from working the full workday that he or she would otherwise have been scheduled to work; or A physician or other licensed health care professional recommends that the employee not perform one or more of the routine functions of his or her job, or not work the full workday that he or she would otherwise have been scheduled to work."
How do I decide whether an injury or illness is work-related if the employee is on travel status at the time the injury or illness occurs?,"Injuries and illnesses that occur while an employee is on travel status are work-related if, at the time of the injury or illness, the employee was engaged in work activities ""in the interest of the employer."" Examples of such activities include travel to and from customer contacts, conducting job tasks, and entertaining or being entertained to transact, discuss, or promote business (work-related entrainment includes only entertainment activities being engaged in at the direction of the employer)."
How do I determine if an injury or illness is a privacy concern case?,You must consider the following injuries or illnesses to be privacy concern cases:An injury or illness to an intimate body part or the reproductive system;
How do I determine the correct NAICS code for my company or for individual establishments in my company?,"You can determine your NAICS code by using one of three methods: 1) You can use the search feature at the U.S. Census Bureau NAICS main webpage. In the search box for the most recent NAICS, enter a keyword that describes your kind of business. A list of primary business activities containing that keyword and the corresponding NAICS codes will appear. Choose the one that most closely corresponds to your primary business activity, or refine your search to obtain other choices. 2) Rather than searching through a list of primary business activities, you may also view the most recent complete NAICS structure with codes and titles by clicking on the link for the most recent NAICS on the U.S. Census Bureau NAICS main webpage. Then click on the two-digit Sector code to see all the NAICS codes under that Sector. Then choose the six-digit code of your interest to see the corresponding definition, as well as cross-references and index items, when available. 3) If you know your old SIC code, you can also find the appropriate 2002 NAICS code by using the detailed conversion (concordance) between the 1987 SIC and 2002 NAICS available in Excel format for download at the ""Concordances"" link at the U.S. Census Bureau NAICS main webpage. 4) You may also contact your nearest OSHA office or State agency for help in determining your NAICS code."
How do I determine the size of my company to find out if I qualify for the partial exemption for size?,"To determine if you are exempt because of size, you need to determine your company's peak employment during the last calendar year. If you had no more than 10 employees at any time in the last calendar year, your company qualifies for the partial exemption for size."
How do I determine whether an Over-The-Counter medication is considered prescription strength?,"When medications are available in both prescription and non-prescription strengths, the employer should consider the medication to be at prescription strength if it is given at a dosage above the dosage in the directions of the over-the counter or OTC form."
How do I determine whether or not a case is an occupational injury or one of the occupational illness categories in Section M of the OSHA 300 Log?,"The instructions that accompany the OSHA 300 Log contain examples of occupational injuries and the various types of occupational illnesses listed on the Log. If the case you are dealing with is on one of those lists, then check that injury or illness category. If the case you are dealing with is not listed, then you may check the injury or illness category that you believe best fits the circumstances of the case."
How do I find OSHA's Form 300 and 300A? I have looked on your website but cannot seem to find the actual form to print out.,The forms are located athttp://www.osha.gov/recordkeeping/RKforms.html
How do I handle a case if it is not obvious whether the precipitating event or exposure occurred in the work environment or occurred away from work?,In these situations you must evaluate the employee's work duties and environment to decide whether or not one or more events or exposures in the work environment either caused or contributed to the resulting condition or significantly aggravated a pre-existing condition.
How do I handle a case when a physician or other licensed health care professional recommends that the worker return to work but the employee stays at home anyway?,"In this situation, you must end the count of days away from work on the date the physician and other licensed health care professional recommends that the employee return to work."
"How do I handle vague restriction from a physician or other licensed health care professional, such as that the employee engage only in ""light duty"" or ""take it easy for a week""?","If you are not clear about the physician or other licensed health care professional's recommendation, you may ask that person whether the employee can do all of his or her routine job functions and work all of his or her normally assigned work shift. If the answer to both of these question is ""Yes,"" then the case does not involve a work restriction and does not have to be recorded as such. If the answer to one or both of these questions is ""No,"" the case involves restricted work and must be recorded as a restricted work case. If you' re unable to obtain this additional information from the physician or other licensed health care professional who recommended the restriction, record the injury or illness as a case involving restricted work."

"How do I record a case in which the employee was prescribed restricted work activity and we made it available, but the employee decides on his own, to refuse the restricted work and stays home instead?","In this situation, you count the days as days of restricted work activity as recommended by the physician or other licensed health care professional."
How do I record a case where the doctor recommends that the employee be placed restricted duty or job transfer but there are no restricted duty or job transfer jobs for this person to do therefore the employee was sent home by the company?,"You must count the days as days away from work. To count days as restricted days, restricted work activity must be made available to the employee."
How do I record a case where the worker works only for a partial work shift because of a work-related injury or illness?,"A partial day of work is recorded as a day of job transfer or restriction for recordkeeping purposes, except for the day on which the injury occurred or the illness began."
How do I record a work-related injury or illness that results in days away from work?,"When an injury or illness involves one or more days away, you must record the injury or illness on the OSHA 300 Log with a check mark in the space for cases involving days away and an entry of the number of calendar days away from work in the number of days column. If the employee is out for an extended period of time, you must enter an estimate of the days that the employee will be away, and update the day count when the actual number of days is known."
How do I record a work-related injury or illness that results in restricted work or job transfer?,"When a injury or illness involves restricted work or job transfer but does not involve death or days away from work, you must record the injury or illness on the OSHA 300 Log by placing a check mark in the space for job transfer or restriction and an entry of the number of restricted or transferred days in the restricted workdays column."

How do the 2007 to 2012 NAICS coding changes for the Full and Limited Service Restaurant Industries affect the exemption status of establishments in these industries?,"The list of partially exempt industries is based on 2007 NAICS codes. Under that coding system, restaurants are classified as NAICS 7221, Full-Service Restaurants, or NAICS 7222, Limited-Service Eating Places. Both of these industries are included in Appendix A to Subpart B of the Part 1904 regulation. The fact that these industries are now classified in 2012 NAICS 7225, Restaurants and Other Eating Places, does not change their partially exempt status."
How do we calculate an annual incident rate?,"You can compute the incidence rate for all recordable cases of injuries and illnesses using the following formula:Total number of injuries and illnesses X 200,000 / Number of hours worked by all employees = Total recordable case rate"

How do you differentiate between an amputation without bone and avulsions?,"If and when there is a health care professional's diagnosis available, the employer should rely on that diagnosis. If the diagnosis is avulsion, the event does not need to be reported. If the diagnosis is amputation, the event must be reported. If there is no available diagnosis by a health care professional, the employer should rely on the definition and examples of amputation included in the regulatory text of section 1904.39. Examples of avulsion that do not need to be reported include deglovings, scalpings, fingernail and toenail avulsions, eyelid avulsions, tooth avulsions, and severed ears. Remember, employers are required to report amputations to OSHA when they learn that the reportable event occurred. The employer must report the event when he or she has information that the injury is a work-related amputation."
How does an employer inform each employee on how he or she is to report an injury or illness?,"Employers are required to let employees know how and when to report work-related injuries and illnesses. This means that the employer must set up a way for the employees to report work-related injuries and illnesses and tell its employees how to use it. The Recordkeeping rule does not specify how the employer must accomplish these objectives, so employers have flexibility to set up systems that are appropriate to their workplace. The size of the workforce, employee's language proficiency and literacy levels, the workplace culture, and other factors will determine what will be effective for any particular workplace."
"How does OSHA define ""amputation""?","An amputation is the traumatic loss of a limb or other external body part. Amputations include a part, such as a limb or appendage, that has been severed, cut off, amputated (either completely or partially); fingertip amputations with or without bone loss; medical amputations resulting from irreparable damage; amputations of body parts that have since been reattached. Amputations do not include avulsions (tissue torn away from the body), enucleations (removal of the eyeball), deglovings (skin torn away from the underlying tissue), scalpings (removal of the scalp), severed ears, or broken or chipped teeth."
"How does OSHA define ""in-patient hospitalization""?",OSHA defines in-patient hospitalization as a formal admission to the in-patient service of a hospital or clinic for care or treatment.
"How does OSHA define a ""company parking lot"" for purposes of Recordkeeping?","Company parking lots are part of the employer's premises and therefore part of the establishment. These areas are under the control of the employer, i.e. those parking areas where the employer can limit access (such as parking lots limited to the employer's employees and visitors). On the other hand, a parking area where the employer does not have control (such as a parking lot outside of a building shared by different employers, or a public parking area like those found at a mall or beneath a multi-employer office building) would not be considered part of the employers establishment (except for the owner of the building or mall), and therefore not a company parking lot for purposes of OSHA recordkeeping."
How extensively do I have to review the OSHA 300 Log entries at the end of the year?,You must review the entries as extensively as necessary to make sure that they are complete and correct.
"How is an employer to determine whether an employee has ""recovered completely"" from a previous injury or illness such that a later injury or illness of the same type affecting the same part of the body resulting from an event or exposure at work is a ""new case"" under section 1904.6(a)(2)? If an employee's signs and symptoms disappear for a day and then resurface the next day, should the employer conclude that the later signs and symptoms represent a new case?","An employee has ""recovered completely"" from a previous injury or illness, for purposes of section 1904.6(a)(2), when he or she is fully healed or cured. The employer must use his best judgment based on factors such as the passage of time since the symptoms last occurred and the physical appearance of the affected part of the body. If the signs and symptoms of a previous injury disappear for a day only to reappear the following day, that is strong evidence the injury has not properly healed. The employer may, but is not required to, consult a physician or other licensed health care provider (PLHCP). Where the employer does consult a PLHCP to determine whether an employee has recovered completely from a prior injury or illness, it must follow the PLHCP's recommendation. In the event the employer receives recommendations from two or more PLHCPs, the employer may decide which recommendation is the most authoritative and record the case based on that recommendation."
"How is the term ""supervised"" in section 1904.31 defined for the purpose of determining whether the host employer must record the work-related injuries and illnesses of employees obtained from a temporary help service?","The host employer must record the recordable injuries and illnesses of employees not on its payroll if it supervises them on a day-to-day basis. Day-to-day supervision occurs when ""in addition to specifying the output, product or result to be accomplished by the person's work, the employer supervises the details, means, methods and processes by which the work is to be accomplished."""
How long am I required to keep an OSHA 300 log?,"You must save the OSHA 300 Log, the privacy case list (if one exists), the annual summary, and the OSHA 301 Incident Report forms for five (5) years following the end of the calendar year that these records cover."
How long are companies required to maintain past OSHA 300 logs and related information?,"You must save the OSHA 300 Log, the privacy case list (if one exists), the annual summary, and the OSHA 301 Incident Report forms for five (5) years following the end of the calendar year that these records cover."
How long must a modification to a job last before it can be considered a permanent modification under section 1904.7(b)(4)(xi)?,"Section 1904.7(b)(4)(xi) of the rule allows an employer to stop counting days of restricted work or transfer to another job if the restriction or transfer is made permanent. A permanent restriction or transfer is one that is expected to last for the remainder of the employee's career. Where the restriction or transfer is determined to be permanent at the time it is ordered, the employer must count at least one day of the restriction or transfer on the Log. If the employee whose work is restricted or who is transferred to another job is expected to return to his or her former job duties at a later date, the restriction or transfer is considered temporary rather than permanent."
How many days are to be counted in the case of a recordable occupational death?,"None. In the case of an occupational fatality, enter a checkmark in column G (death) on the 300 log. No days are enter in column K."
How many days away from work are accounted for a work related fatality?,"None. For a work related fatality, enter a checkmark in column G. No days away from work are entered in column K."
How many employees must be employed for an employer be required to complete and post form 300A?,"Eleven. If your company had ten(10) or fewer employees at all times during the last calendar year, you do not need to keep OSHA injury and illness records unless OSHA or the BLS informs you in writing that you must keep records. However, as required by 1904.39, all employers covered by the OSH Act must report to OSHA any workplace incident that results in a fatality, amputation, in-patient hospitalization, or loss of an eye. The test for the small employer exemption is based on the number of employees in the entire firm, not the number in an individual establishment."
How many hours are allowed for management/supervisor/salaried employees in incident rate calculation?,"There is no cap on the number of hours you may use. You should use the actual hours worked by the individuals. If you do not keep records on the hours worked by management, an estimate is acceptable. Generally, an individual that works 8 hours per day works 2000 hours per year (8 hours X 5 days X 50 weeks = 2000 hours)."
"How many hours worked are counted in off-shore daily activities (e.g. work on oil platforms, rigs), 12 or 24 hours?","The figure for hours worked should reflect the actual hours of work-related exposure for all employees. If injuries and illnesses experienced during a particular activity are recordable, then the employee's time spent in the activity should be included in the hours worked estimate. Work-related exposures include most of the employees' activities on the employers' premises as well as situations where the employees are there as a condition of employment. If the oil rig worker is required to be on the rig 24/7 as a condition of employment, then 24 hours per day should be used to calculate hours worked."
How may state regulations differ from the Federal requirements?,"For Part 1904 provisions other than recording and reporting, State requirements may be more stringent than or supplemental to the Federal requirements. For example, a State Plan could require employers to keep records for the State, even though those employers have 10 or fewer employees (1904.1) or are within an industry exempted by the Federal rule. A State Plan could also require employers to keep additional supplementary injury and illness information, require employers to report fatality and severe injury incidents within a shorter time frame than Federal OSHA does (1904.39), require other types of incidents to be reported as they occur, require hearing loss to be recorded at a lower threshold level during CY 2002 (1904.10(c)), or impose other requirements."
How quickly must each injury or illness be recorded?,You must enter each recordable injury or illness on the OSHA 300 Log and 301 Incident Report within seven (7) calendar days of receiving information that a recordable injury or illness has occurred.
How should an employer inform employees of their right to report work-related injuries and illnesses free from retaliation by their employer?,"One way for employers to meet this requirement is by posting the OSHA ""It's The Law"" worker rights poster from April 2015 or later (http://www.osha.gov/Publications/poster.html). Employers also must establish a reporting procedure that does not deter or discourage an employee from reporting work-related injuries and illnesses."
"How should I document an exposure to poison ivy, oak, sumac, etc..? Is this a recordable injury/illness that needs to documented on my 300 forms? Some people can use over the counter medications, others need medical attention which usually includes injections and prescriptions.","Reactions to work-related exposure to poisonous plant are recordable if they require medical treatment beyond first aid, days away from work, restricted work activity or job transfer. The issuance of prescription medication would make this case recordable. The use of over-the-counter medication would not."
"How should I record an injury if the treating physician recommends modified / restricted duty for an employee, but the employer has no work to accommodate the employee's restrictions and therefore the employee must stay home?","You must count the days as days away from work. To count days as restricted days, restricted work activity must be made available to the employee."
"How would a company record an injury that was a result of a personal medical illness (diabetes)? The employee felt weak, started to faint, fell and broke their hip.","If an employee's pre-existing medical condition is the sole cause of the incident which results in a subsequent injury, this is not a work-related injury and is not recordable. However, if the work environment or work activities of the employee contributed to the employee's faintness, this would be a recordable injury."
How would I go about finding an experience modification number for a company?,The Experience Modification Rate (EMR) is a rate assigned by your worker's compensation insurance carrier. Please contact your carrier for this information.
"How would the employer record the change on the OSHA 300 Log for an injury or illness after the injured worker reached the cap of 180 days for restricted work and then was assigned to ""days away from work""?","The employer must check the box that reflects the most severe outcome associated with a given injury or illness. The severity of any case decreases on the log from column G (Death) to column J (Other recordable case). Since days away from work is a more severe outcome than restricted work the employer is required to remove the check initially placed in the box for job transfer or restriction and enter a check in the box for days away from work (column H). Employers are allowed to cap the number of days away and/or restricted work/job transfer when a case involves 180 calendar days. For purposes of recordability, the employer would enter 180 days in the ""Job transfer or restriction"" column and may also enter 1 day in the ""Days away from work"" column to prevent confusion or computer related problems."
How would you determine the number of days on restricted work activity if the employee does not return for follow-up medical and therefore is never officially released for full-duty?,"If the initial medical visit indicated a specific time frame for restricted days, use that as your day count. If it did not, but it did have a specified date for a follow-up visit, you can end the count using that date. If neither of these exist, give your best estimate on how much time the employee needed to recuperate or use the date the employee actually returned to full-duty."
"I am an onsite licensed physical therapist for a manufacturing company. If an employee pops into my office and complains of some mild discomfort (such as neck pain) related to his job and I observe him performing his job and make suggestions for use of an improved work technique that would be less irritating to his neck, does this incident then become a recordable on the OSHA 300 log?",No. A suggestion of an improved work technique is not considered medical treatment for OSHA recordkeeping purposes.
"I am completing the OSHA form 300A and need clarification on estimating total hours worked. Is there a standard number of hours employers should use for number of hours worked if the employer does not track vacation, sick days, holidays, etc. for each employee?","2,000 hours is the standard number of hours a full-time worker works. This is based on 50 weeks worked (on average two weeks vacation) a year and a 40 hour work week."
"I am getting the OSHA 300A forms ready for posting the next year and I have a question on how many employees to put down. We have several establishments, and they all need to post their own log. All together, the company has about 150 employees, but each branch location only has 5-8 employees. For the annual average # of employees and the hours worked, do I put the total for the company or just the for each location.","OSHA injury and illness records are kept by establishment, so only use the information for each establishment on the 300 Log and 300A summary."
I am going to be taking over the Workman's Comp. claims in our office. Are there training manuals and forms that you can send me?,OSHA does not administer workers compensation programs. Each state runs its own program. OSHA does have injury and illness recordkeeping requirements that can be found at this link on the websitehttp://www.osha.gov/recordkeeping/index.html
I am in need of a fresh copy of the OSHA log. Where on the internet could I find one?,The forms can be found athttp://www.osha.gov/recordkeeping/RKforms.html
I am new to filling out the OSHA forms 300 & 300A. I have not had any training on how to fill out the forms.  Can you help?,Please visithttp://www.osha.gov/recordkeeping/tutorial.htmlfor a tutorial on how to complete the OSHA recordkeeping forms.
I am setting up a program to measure our manufacturing plants accident frequency and severity. My plan is to compare the rates between our plants and the national average within our industry. Does OSHA have any such rates by industry?,You can find occupational injury and illness statistical information on the Bureau of Labor Statistics webpage athttp://www.bls.gov/iif/home.htm
I am updating our Computer Based Training and have injury and illness statistics dated 1996. Where can I find more recent statistics?,You can find occupational injury and illness statistical information on the Bureau of Labor Statistics webpage athttp://www.bls.gov/iif/home.htm
"I am working on form 300 and have an employee who was injured in 2009. He was off work all of 2010 due to surgery, physical therapy, and complications. Do I record the case on the 2009, 2010 and 2011 Logs?",You are only required to record the case on the 300 log in the year the work-related injury or illness resulted in the recording criteria. Your case in question should only be entered in 2009 log and you may stop the days away count at 180 days.
I cannot locate our 300A form completed for last year and I am in need of that document. Is there a way I can obtain a copy of my completed form from OSHA?,"OSHA does not have copies of employers' 300 and 300A forms. OSHA requires employers to retain copies of the forms on site for a 5 year period. If you are unable to locate your forms, you should recreate the 300 and 300A forms as best as possible from medical and workers compensation records from that year."
I don't have to keep OSHA records because my company has fewer than 11 employees. Do I still have to report these events?,"Yes, all employers under OSHA jurisdiction must report fatalities, in-patient hospitalizations, amputations, and losses of an eye to OSHA, even if they are exempt from routinely keeping OSHA records."
"I got a six-digit NAICS code for my company or establishment from the Census web page, but the updated list of industries lists four-digit NAICS codes. How do I determine whether my company's or establishment's industry is included in the updated list?",The four-digit NAICS code for your company or establishment is the first four digits of your six-digit NAICS code.
I have a facility where a temporary employee was injured. We supervise the worker on a day-to-day basis and the case has been entered on our 300 log. The injury has resulted in days away from work. How do I track the day count if the temp agency reassigns the worker to another employer?,"If the employee was reassigned because of the injury, you must estimate the total number of days away the employee would have needed to recuperate and enter the day count on the 300 Log. If the temporary job would have ended prior to that time, you may end the count when the job ended."
I have an employee that was injured 3 months ago. Her injury was recorded and treated and resolved. Now she says it is bothering her again due to work and wants further follow up. Do I record it as another injury or is it a continuation of the same injury from 3 months ago?,"You must consider this to be a new case if the employee had recovered completely (all signs and symptoms had disappeared) from the previous injury or illness and the new exposure in the work environment caused the signs or symptoms to reappear. An employee has ""recovered completely"" from a previous injury or illness when he or she is fully healed or cured. The employer must use his best judgment based on factors such as the passage of time since the symptoms last occurred and the physical appearance of the affected part of the body. If, for example, the signs and symptoms of a previous injury disappear for a day only to reappear the following day, that is strong evidence the injury had not completely healed."
"I have an employee who injured his back at work while lifting. The employee reported to the medical dept. which sent him home for the remainder of the work shift, but received no other treatment of any kind. The employee returned to work the next day and resumed all regular activities. Does the fact that this employee's work was restricted for part of the work shift on the day of injury only make this case recordable on the OSHA 300 log?","No, this case is not recordable. Restricted work activity begins on the day after the injury occurred or the illness began."
"I have an employee who was injured and off work for several days, and has been on restricted duty for a few months. When recording the number of days for each, do I count Saturday's, Sunday's and holidays?","Yes. You must count the number of CALENDAR DAYS the employee was unable to work as a result of the injury or illness, regardless of whether or not the employee was scheduled to work on those day(s). Weekend days, holidays, vacation days or other days off are included in the total number of days recorded."
I have completed the OSHA 300 and 300A forms. Where do I send that information?,"You must retain the forms at your establishment for 5 years after the reference year of the records. Beginning in 2017, some employers will be required to submit information from their forms to OSHA. Seewww.osha.gov/injuryreporting/index.htmlfor further information."
"I have completed the OSHA forms 300, and 300A. Do I need to send copies of these forms to OSHA? If so what address do I mail them to?","Keep these forms on file at your establishment for five (5) years following the end of the calendar year that these records cover.  Beginning in 2017, some employers will be required to submit information from their forms to OSHA. Seewww.osha.gov/injuryreporting/index.htmlfor further information."
"I have had several workers compensation claims this year. I appealed a few of them and won, therefore the claims were denied. Because they were denied, do I need to document these claims on my OSHA 300 form?",Workers' Compensation determinations do not impact OSHA recordability. The employer must evaluate each case using the OSHA recording criteria to determine if a case is recordable on the OSHA Form 300.
I have heard there is an injury and illness recordkeeping regulation. Does an employer that has 3 employees have to comply with this regulation?,"Employers that had no more than 10 employees at any time during the previous year are not required to keep injury and illness records under Part 1904. All employers are required to report work-related incidents involving fatalities, amputations, in-patient hospitalizations, or the loss of an eye to OSHA. Employers are also required to maintain the recordkeeping forms if they are notified in writing by OSHA or the BLS to do so."
I have posted OSHA form 300A in our company break room. I have received new information about an accident that occurred on Dec 20 that will extend the restricted days to the full 180 max count. Do I need to fill out a new OSHA Form 300A or can I just update the current form that is posted?,"You are not required to update the 300A Annual Summary, although you may update the form if you wish to do so. However, you must update the OSHA Form 300 to reflect the new information."
"I have read in the record keeping regulation that the following are automatically recordable ""significant injuries"": cancer, chronic irreversible disease, a fracture or cracked bone, or a punctured eardrum. I am unclear if the following are recordable or not: carpal tunnel syndrome, torn tendons, laceration to eye.","Cancer, chronic irreversible disease, a fracture or cracked bone, or a punctured eardrum are the only conditions defined as ""significant injuries"". Carpal tunnel syndrome, torn tendons, or a laceration to the eye are recordable only if they meet the general recording criteria: medical treatment beyond first aid, days away from work, restricted work activity, job transfer, or loss of consciousness."
"I have to fill out a safety performance history for our company. At the bottom of the form it asks for ""EMR"" history. I do not know what this is?",The Experience Modification Rate (EMR) is a rate assigned by your worker's compensation insurance carrier. Please contact your carrier for this information.
"I need access to the current versions of the Injury and Illness Record Keeping forms 300, 300A, 301. All the links I am able to find lead me to the old rev. 2004 docs. I know the rules and regulations changed for 2015 but I cannot find the forms that reflect those changes.",The current OSHA Recordkeeping forms are the 01/2004 versions. The 2015 changes to the regulation did not modify the forms. The forms are available athttps://www.osha.gov/recordkeeping/RKforms.html
I prepare a monthly safety report for my senior managers and would like to add national industry averages to it so that they can compare our performance to others in the industry. Where can I find current information on this?,You can find occupational injury and illness statistical information on the Bureau of Labor Statistics webpage athttp://www.bls.gov/iif/home.htm
"I thought one could go online to ""pull"" reports that show reported incidents of a particular company. Is this information available online?",You can search for establishment specific injury and illness rates athttp://www.osha.gov/pls/odi/establishment_search.html
"I understand that in classifying a case you check the most severe consequence so for a case with both days away and restricted days you would check column H. However, would you enter the number of days for both restrictions and days away or would you only enter the number of days away?",Enter both day counts.  Since days away are the most severe you would check column H and enter the number of days away in column K and the number of restricted days in column L.
I understand that there is a training tutorial on Recordkeeping. How do I obtain this tutorial?,The tutorial is located athttp://www.osha.gov/recordkeeping/tutorial.html
I work in the office at a small company. There are fewer than 10 full time employees. Do we need to do the record keeping of injuries and end of year summary?,"No. If your company had ten(10) or fewer employees at all times during the last calendar year, you do not need to keep OSHA injury and illness records unless OSHA or the BLS informs you in writing that you must keep records. However, as required by 1904.39, all employers covered by the OSH Act must report to OSHA any workplace incident that results in a fatality, amputation, in-patient hospitalization, or loss of an eye."
I would like to be able to obtain injury and illness statistics for individual companies: Is there a way I can look up these stats?,You can search for establishment specific injury and illness rates athttp://www.osha.gov/pls/odi/establishment_search.html
"I would like to gain more clarity in how to classify a work related loss of consciousness due to exposure to H2S. Is this a recordable? If it is recordable, is it an injury or an illness?","You must record a work-related injury or illness if the worker becomes unconscious, regardless of the length of time the employee remains unconscious. Employers should look at the examples of injuries and illnesses in the ""Classifying Injuries and Classifying Illnesses"" section of the Recordkeeping Forms Package for guidance. Poisoning by Hydrogen Sulfide is included as an example for Column M(4) on the OSHA Log."
I would like to know the number of forklift/lift truck related fatalities and injuries reported in the workplace during the year for the entire country. Where can I find this information?,You can find occupational injury and illness statistical information on the Bureau of Labor Statistics webpage athttp://www.bls.gov/iif/home.htm
"I'm finding all your various rate calculations to be confusing. Please provide the formulas and definitions for your relevant calculations--specifically TCR, DAFWII, and DART. We'd like to benchmark ourselves and do annual comparisons.","The various rates are incidence rates per 100 full-time workers and are calculated using the following formula: (Number of injuries and illnesses X 200,000) / Employee hours worked = Incidence rateFor the Number of injuries and illnesses in the formula above:"
"If a business logs an injury on the 300 log but later finds out that the injury was not work related and was denied as Worker's Compensation, can the entry be removed from the 300 Log?","Workers' Compensation determinations do not impact OSHA recordability. The employer must evaluate the employee's work duties and the work environment to decide whether an event or exposure in the work environment either caused or contributed to the condition or significantly aggravated a pre-existing condition. If so, the case is work-related."
"If a case occurs in one year but result in days away during the next calendar year, do I record the case in both years?","No, you only record the injury or illness once. You must enter the number of calendar days away for the injury or illness on the OSHA 300 Log for the year in which the injury or illness occurred. If the employee is still away from work because of the injury or illness when you prepare the annual summary, estimate the total number of calendar days you expect the employee to be away from work, use the number to calculate the total for the annual summary, and then update the initial log entry later when the day count is known or reaches the 180-day cap."
"If a doctor gives an employee a sample of prescription strength medication, is it recordable?","Yes. Once a doctor prescribes or gives a prescription medication to an employee, the work-related injury is recordable. This includes the issuance of samples of prescription medication."
"If a doctor is dealing with someone who is very excited because they have been injured and the physician gives the employee a single dose of a drug to calm the employee down (assisting diagnosis), would that be a recordable injury?","Yes, this case is recordable. Any use of prescription medication makes a work related injury or illness recordable."
If a large company is divided throughout many different buildings---are they required to have an OSHA 300 Form per building?,"A campus location may keep a single log for the entire campus. If it is not a campus setting, a single log can be kept for multiple locations that are all located in close proximity to each other. For example, two buildings within a block of each other can have a single log. On the other hand, two buildings separated by a mile must have two separate logs."
"If a local truck driver left his last stop and was heading home and had an accident and needed medical help other than first aid, would this be an OSHA recordable?","No. For OSHA recordkeeping purposes, an employee's normal commute from home to office and return would not be considered work-related. Therefore, any injury or illness occurring during this trip would not be recordable."
"If a maintenance employee is cleaning the parking lot or an access road and is injured as a result, is the case work-related?","Yes, the case is work-related because the employee is injured as a result of conducting company business in the work environment. If the injury meets the general recording criteria of Section 1904.7 (death, days away, etc.), the case must be recorded."
"If a man is injured on my site while changing into clothes required for work, prior to the start of his shift, is this injury work related?",Injuries and illnesses occurring in the work environment are considered work-related. Punching in and out with a time clock (or signing in and out) does not affect the outcome for determining work-relatedness. This scenario does not meet the work-related exception for personal grooming because he was changing into the clothes that are required for work.
If a person is sprayed while doing their job by a crop duster should that be put on the OSHA log?,"Chemical exposures in and of themselves are not recordable on the OSHA Log. An injury or illness must exist (i.e. the employee must show abnormal symptoms from the exposure) and the case must meet one or more of the general recording criteria (medical treatment beyond first aid; days away from work; restricted work activity; job transfer; loss of consciousness; ""significant"" diagnosed injury or illness)."
"If a physician or other licensed health care professional determines the hearing loss is not work-related, do I still need to record the case?","If a physician or other licensed health care professional determines that the hearing loss is not work-related or has not been significantly aggravated by occupational noise exposure, you are not required to consider the case work-related or to record the case on the OSHA 300 Log."
"If a physician or other licensed health care professional recommends medical treatment, days away from work or restricted work activity as a result of a work-related injury or illness can the employer decline to record the case based on a contemporaneous second provider's opinion that the recommended medical treatment, days away from work or work restriction are unnecessary, if the employer believes the second opinion is more authoritative?","Yes. However, once medical treatment is provided for a work-related injury or illness, or days away from work or work restriction have occurred, the case is recordable. If there are conflicting contemporaneous recommendations regarding medical treatment, or the need for days away from work or restricted work activity, but the medical treatment is not actually provided and no days away from work or days of work restriction have occurred, the employer may determine which recommendation is the most authoritative and record on that basis. In the case of prescription medications, OSHA considers that medical treatment is provided once a prescription is issued."
"If a self-employed person is injured or becomes ill while doing work at my business, do I need to record the injury or illness?","No, self-employed individuals are not covered by the OSH Act or this regulation."
"If a temporary personnel agency sends its employees to work in an establishment that is not required to keep OSHA records, does the agency have to record the recordable injuries and illnesses of these employees?","A temporary personnel agency need not record injuries and illnesses of those employees that are supervised on a day-to-day basis by another employer. The temporary personnel agency must record the recordable injuries and illnesses of those employees it supervises on a day to day basis, even if these employees perform work for an employer who is not covered by the recordkeeping rule."
"If a work-related injury results in both days away from work and restricted duty days, is the total number of days (lost time + restricted duty) capped at 180 days or would the 180 day cap apply individually to lost time and restricted duty (i.e., Lost time max - 180, restricted duty max - 180)?",You may stop counting days away from work or days of restricted work activity once the combination of both reaches 180 days (days away + days restricted = 180).
If a worker is involved in a fatal injury on the work site is there a standard number of days away entered into the days away column (column K) on the OSHA log?,No. A fatality is recorded with a checkmark in column G of the log and no day count is entered in column K.
If a worker is stung by a bee and has to go to the doctor due to swelling is it considered an OSHA recordable.,The case is recordable if the injury requires one or more of the following; medical treatment beyond first aid (e.g. prescription medication); restricted work activity; job transfer; or days away from work.
"If a worker stepped on a nail and is given a tetanus shot to treat that injury (no lost time), is this a recordable case?","No, this is not a recordable case. Tetanus immunization is included on the first aid list."
If an associate is injured and is released back to work with restrictions. Three days later that he doesn't want to come to work and calls his doctor stating he has knee pain and asks for a note from his doctor. The doctor then gives him 2 days off from work stating it is because of his work related knee injury. Is this considered a loss of time?,"Yes, this would be considered ""Days away from work"" because a physician stated the employee needed two days off from work because of the work related knee injury."
If an employee chips a tooth that is a crown is this a recordable?,"If an employee chips or breaks a tooth, it is a recordable case. If an employee chips or breaks a crown, it is a recordable case if it results in any of the following: medical treatment beyond first aid; restricted work activity; job transfer; loss of consciousness; or days away from work."
If an employee declares himself unfit for work due to a work related event is it recordable as a case involving days away from work?,The employee's decision does not determine the outcome for recordability. Nor is a medical opinion required in this situation. The employer must make a good faith decision as to whether the employee needed the days away from work for recuperation and record appropriately.
"If an employee developed a rash from oil used in the manufacturing process and was given an OTC cream at the clinic, is that considered ""more than first aid""?","No, using a non-prescription medication at non-prescription strength is considered first aid for OSHA recordkeeping purposes. Note that when medications are available in both prescription and non-prescription form, a recommendation by a physician or other licensed health care professional to use a non-prescription medication at prescription strength is considered medical treatment for recordkeeping purposes."
"If an employee dies during surgery made necessary by a work-related injury or illness, is the case recordable? What if the surgery occurs weeks or months after the date of the injury or illness?","If an employee dies as a result of surgery or other complications following a work-related injury or illness, the case is recordable. If the underlying injury or illness was recorded prior to the employee's death, the employer must update the Log by lining out information on less severe outcomes, e.g., days away from work or restricted work, and checking the column indicating death."
"If an employee experienced a recordable hearing loss case, where would the employer record the case on the OSHA 300 Log?","Prior to 2004, employers should record work-related hearing loss cases according to the instructions included with the Recordkeeping Forms. If the loss is associated with an event, such as acoustic trauma (e.g., an explosion), it would be recorded as an injury with a check mark in column (M)(1). If the loss is not an injury, it would be recorded as an illness, with a check mark in the all other illness column. Beginning in January 2004, employers must record all hearing loss cases in the separate hearing loss column (M)(5)."
If an employee fails a post accident screen for illegal drugs and alcohol is a workplace accident still considered to be work related?,"Yes. You must consider an injury or illness to be work-related if an event or exposure in the work environment either caused or contributed to the resulting condition or significantly aggravated a pre-existing injury or illness. Work-relatedness is presumed for injuries and illnesses resulting from events or exposures occurring in the work environment, unless an exception in § 1904.5(b)(2) specifically applies. There is no exception for alcohol or drug impairment under 1904.5(b)(2)."
"If an employee falls in the company parking lot but has not punched the clock, is this work related?",Yes. The company parking lot is part of the work environment. Being on or off the clock is not determinative.
"If an employee had an injury and went to the doctor and had an x-ray done but nothing was broken and no further treatment was provided, is this a recordable injury?","No. Diagnostic procedures, such as x-rays are not considered medical treatment."
"If an employee has a back injury in March and then again in September of the same year, can they be combined as one case?","The September injury should be evaluated as a new case if the employee recovered completely (all signs and symptoms had disappeared) from the previous injury and an event or exposure in the work environment caused the signs or symptoms to reappear. If the signs and symptoms of the original case persisted, you can evaluate this as one case."
If an employee has an adverse reaction to a smallpox vaccination; is it recordable under OSHA's recordkeeping rule?,"If an employee has an adverse reaction to a smallpox vaccination, the reaction is recordable if it is work related (see 29 CFR 1904.5) and meets the general recording criteria contained in 29 CFR 1904.7. A reaction caused by a smallpox vaccination is work related if the vaccination was necessary to enable the employee to perform his or her work duties. Such a reaction is work-related even though the employee was not required to receive it, if the vaccine was provided by the employer to protect the employee against exposure to smallpox in the work environment. For example, if a health care employer establishes a program to vaccinate employees who may be involved in treating people suffering from the effects of a smallpox outbreak, reactions to the vaccine would be work related. The same principle applies to adverse reactions among emergency response workers whose duties may cause them to be exposed to smallpox. The vaccinations in this circumstance are analogous to inoculations given to employees to immunize them from diseases to which they may be exposed to in the course of work-related overseas travel."
"If an employee has an injury, is hospitalized and dies 10 days after the accidents do we count the 10 days prior to the death as lost work days?",No. Days away from work are not counted fatal injuries.
"If an employee has an object in his eye that is NOT embedded, but the medic chooses to remove it with a magnet instead of a cotton swab. Is this injury recordable?","The injury is recordable. Use of a magnet to remove an object from the eye is medical treatment, it is not included on the first aid list."
"If an employee has arrived in the parking lot of our facility but has not clocked or signed in, and they trip and fall going from the automobile to the clock-in location and breaks a leg, is this recordable?","Yes, this is a recordable case. The parking lot is considered part of the establishment and thus the work environment. Punching in/out on a time clock does not determine work relatedness."
"If an employee has been released by the doctor to ""light duty"", however, the employer cannot accommodate the restrictions (has no place for the employee to work) - is that recorded as ""days away"" or ""restricted days"" on the OSHA log?","You must count the days as days away from work. To count days as restricted days, restricted work activity must be made available to the employee."
"If an employee has been released for light duty, but we don't have any light duty available, do I record this as restricted duty or days off?","You must count the days as days away from work. To count days as restricted days, restricted work activity must be made available to the employee."
"If an employee has both lost time and restricted duty, does the cap mean a total of both categories or 180 days for each category separately?",You may cap the day count when a combination of the two categories reaches 180 days.
"If an employee has days away from work that span one year to the next (e.g. out from December through March), do you go back and update the previous year's log to reflect the total days out?","Yes. You must enter the number of calendar days away for the injury or illness on the OSHA 300 Log for the year in which the injury or illness occurred. If the employee is still away from work because of the injury or illness when you prepare the annual summary, estimate the total number of calendar days you expect the employee to be away from work, use this number to calculate the total for the annual summary, and then update the initial log entry later when the day count is known or reaches the 180-day cap."
"If an employee has missed work days due to injury and then has returns to work on restricted duty, do you record both the lost days and the restricted days on the 300 log?","Yes, enter both day counts.  Since days away are the most severe you would check column H and enter the number of days away in column K. When the employee returns on restricted duty you would enter the number of days in column L."
"If an employee has surgery for a work related injury and misses one day (not the date of the injury) for the surgery which was on a Friday and returns to work on Monday, is this a recordable case with days away from work?","Yes, the day of the surgery would be considered a day away from work. You begin counting calendar days on the day after the injury occurred. If you received information from the health care provider that the worker may return to work on Monday you would include Saturday and Sunday in your calendar day count as well."
"If an employee in my establishment is a contractor's employee, must I record an injury or illness occurring to that employee?","If the contractor's employee is under the day-to-day supervision of the contractor, the contractor is responsible for recording the injury or illness. If you supervise the contractor employee's work on a day-to-day basis, you must record the injury or illness."
"If an employee injures themselves and goes to see a physician the next day, is it considered a Lost Work Day because it is not the day the injury took place?","No, time missed seeking medical treatment is not counted as days away from work or days of restricted work activity if the employee is otherwise capable of performing all of his or her routine job functions."
"If an employee is admitted to the hospital for Carpal Tunnel surgery, is this reportable?","To be reportable, the in-patient hospitalization must occur within 24 hours of the work-related incident that injured or made the employee ill. Scheduled surgeries that occur beyond this 24 hour period are not reportable to OSHA."
"If an employee is exposed to chlorine or some other substance at work and oxygen is administered as a precautionary measure, is the case recordable?","If oxygen is administered as a purely precautionary measure to an employee who does not exhibit any symptoms of an injury or illness, the case is not recordable. If the employee exposed to a substance exhibits symptoms of an injury or illness, the administration of oxygen makes the case recordable."
"If an employee is given a prescription by the doctor, but does NOT use it, is it still considered medical treatment?","Yes, once the prescription medication is written by the physician it is considered medical treatment, even if the patient does not take the medication."
"If an employee is given antibiotics or antivirals after a possible communicable/infectious disease exposure, is it OSHA recordable regardless of seroconversion?","No. To be recordable on the OSHA log an injury or illness must exist. Exposures without signs or symptoms of the illness are not recordable, even if medical treatment is administered."
"If an employee is having surgery due to a work related injury, is the day of surgery considered a day away from work, or is that just time spent seeking medical treatment?",You must count the day of surgery as a day away from work if the date of surgery was subsequent to the date of injury and the employee was not physically able to perform work because of the surgery.
"If an employee is hospitalized as an in-patient and the only care or treatment provided is from OSHA's ""first aid list"" (for example if the only treatment is non-prescription medication), does the event become reportable?","Yes. A work-related in-patient hospitalization involving any treatment needs to be reported to OSHA. The reporting requirement in the regulatory text of section 1904.39 does not limit care or treatment to ""medical treatment beyond first aid."""
"If an employee is in an auto accident while commuting to work in a company vehicle, is this work-related?","No. Injuries incurred while commuting from work to home or from home to work are not considered work related, even if the vehicle is a company vehicle."
"If an employee is injured and accumulates 200 restricted days in the period from January to July then has 10 days away from work in August, how do I record the case?","Check column (H) to reflect the most serious outcome, days away from work. Place ""180"" in column (L) to reflect the days of restricted work activity that were first incurred. You may also choose to enter 1 day in the ""Days away from work"" column (K) to prevent confusion or computer related problems."
"If an employee is injured and is given a couple of days off by a doctor, but on that first day after seeing the doctor asks to be and is laid off, would that incident still be counted as a Days Away from Work Case?","You must record the case with at least one day away from work. If the employee leaves your company for some reason unrelated to the injury or illness you may stop counting days away from work or days of restriction/job transfer. If the employee leaves your company because of the injury or illness, you must estimate the total number of days away or days of restriction/job transfer and enter the day count on the 300 Log."
If an employee is injured in the year 2003 and is out of work into the year 2004...how do you record their lost work days/restricted duty days for the OSHA Log 2003?,"You must enter the number of calendar days away for the injury or illness on the OSHA 300 Log for the year in which the injury or illness occurred. If the employee is still away from work because of the injury or illness when you prepare the annual summary, estimate the total number of calendar days you expect the employee to be away from work, use this number to calculate the total for the annual summary, and then update the initial log entry later when the day count is known or reaches the 180-day cap."
"If an employee is injured, but the worker's compensation carrier denies the claim due to the injury being 'not in the scope of employment,' should the injury still be recorded on the OSHA 300 log?","When an injury or illness occurs to an employee, the employer must independently analyze the case in light of both the OSHA recording criteria and the requirements of the State workers' compensation system to determine whether the case is recordable or compensable, or both. Your case must be judged by the criteria of the OSHA recordkeeping rule to determine if it should be placed on the 300 Log. Workers Compensation is not a consideration of whether the case is OSHA recordable or not."
"If an employee is let go from a job based on poor job performance and after being let go comes back and says he was injured on the job, but there is no evidence an injury occurred. Is this considered an OSHA recordable?","If you determine that there was no work-related injury, you do not have to record the case. Under the OSHA recordkeeping system, the employer has the ultimate responsibility for making good-faith recordkeeping determinations regarding an injury and/or illness. Employers must decide if and how a particular case should be recorded and their decision must not be an arbitrary one."
If an employee leaves the company after experiencing a work-related injury or illness that results in days away from work and/or days of restricted work/job transfer how would an employer record the case?,"If the employee leaves the company for some reason(s) unrelated to the injury or illness, section 1904.7(b)(3)(viii) of the rule allows the employer to stop counting days away from work or days of restriction/job transfer. In order to stop a count the employer must first have a count to stop. Thus, the employer must count at least one day away from work or day of restriction/job transfer on the OSHA 300 Log. If the employee leaves the company for some reason(s) related to the injury or illness, section 1904.7(b)(3)(viii) of the rule directs the employer to make an estimate of the count of days away from work or days of restriction/job transfer expected for the particular type of case."
"If an employee loses his arm in a work-related accident and can never return to his job, how is the case recorded? Is the day count capped at 180 days?","If an employee never returns to work following a work-related injury, the employer must check the ""days away from work"" column, and enter an estimate of the number of days the employee would have required to recuperate from the injury, up to180 days."
"If an employee misses a day of work due to an injury which is not reported to the employer, nor are they assessed by a health care professional who recommends days of work, is this classified as a lost time injury?",The employee's decision does not determine the outcome for recordability. Nor is a medical opinion required in this situation. The employer must make a good faith decision as to whether the employee needed the day away from work for recuperation or not and record appropriately.
If an employee obtains an injury at work and the next day on there scheduled day off calls the employer and requests to be seen by a doctor and the doctor says they can return to full duty their first scheduled day back to work is this an OSHA recordable injury? In this case the employee did not miss a scheduled day off.,"You need to record a case of this type only if you receive information from a physician or other licensed health care professional indicating that the employee should not have worked, or should have performed only restricted work, during the scheduled time off. If so, you must record the injury or illness as a case with days away from work or restricted work, and enter the day counts, as appropriate."
"If an employee of a company is commuting from home to a local worksite in a company vehicle and becomes involved in a motor vehicle accident that results in a fatality of the employee, does the accident get recorded on the OSHA 300 log?","No. Injuries incurred while commuting from work to home or from home to work are not considered work related, even if the vehicle is a company vehicle."
"If an employee or representative asks for access to the OSHA 300 Log, when do I have to provide it?","When an employee, former employee, personal representative, or authorized employee representative asks for copies of your current or stored OSHA 300 Log(s) for an establishment the employee or former employee has worked in, you must give the requester a copy of the relevant OSHA 300 Log(s) by the end of the next business day."
"If an employee or representative asks for access to the OSHA 301 Incident Report, when do I have to provide it?","When an employee, former employee, or personal representative asks for a copy of the OSHA 301 Incident Report describing an injury or illness to that employee or former employee, you must give the requester a copy of the OSHA 301 Incident Report containing that information by the end of the next business day."
"If an employee presents a work status that indicates they are able to perform restricted work or light duty work yet we do not have work available that meets the restrictions, should we enter the number of days under ""On Job Transfer or Restriction"" or ""Away from Work?""","You must count the days as days away from work. To count days as restricted days, restricted work activity must be made available to the employee."
"If an employee receives a bee sting (or any other bug bite) at work and has an allergic reaction requiring prescription medication and/or days off work, is this considered a recordable injury?","Yes, this is a recordable injury. The bee sting is considered a work related injury because it occurred within the work environment. The prescription medication/days away make the case recordable."
"If an employee receives a RX from the doctor, but does not fill the RX, is it recordable based on the RX itself?","Once a doctor prescribes a prescription to an employee this becomes recordable, even if the employee does not fill the prescription."
"If an employee reports an injury or illness and receives medical treatment this year, but states that the symptoms first arose at some unspecified date last year, on which year's log do I record the case?","Ordinarily, the case should be recorded on the Log for the year in which the injury or illness occurred. Where the date of injury or illness cannot be determined, the date the employee reported the symptoms or received treatment must be used. In the case in question, the injury or illness would be recorded on this year's Log because the employee cannot specify the date when the symptoms occurred."
"If an employee returns to work after being off with an injury, but only returns for a 4 hr. day instead of their normal 8 hr. day how is this counted?",This would be counted as days of restricted work activity because the employee is working a partial shift.
"If an employee sees a doctor for a minor injury and receives an optional, one-time pain medication shot at prescription strength, is it considered a recordable?",Yes. Use of the prescription medication for a work related injury makes the case recordable.
"If an employee sends his supervisor a text message stating that he won't be coming in today due to his knee being sore from hurting it at work the day before, stays home and then returns to work the next day without seeing a physician, does the day he said he wasn't coming in count as Lost Time?",The employee's decision does not determine the outcome for recordability. Nor is a medical opinion required in this situation. The employer must make a good faith decision as to whether the employee needed the days away from work for recuperation or not and record appropriately.
"If an employee stays at work after normal work hours to prepare for the next day's tasks and is injured, is the case work-related? For example, if an employee stays after work to prepare air-sampling pumps and is injured, is the case work-related?","A case is work-related any time an event or exposure in the work environment either causes or contributes to an injury or illness or significantly aggravates a pre-existing injury or illness, unless one of the exceptions in section 1904.5(b)(2) applies. The work environment includes the establishment and other locations where one or more employees are working or are present as a condition of their employment. The case in question would be work-related if the employee was injured as a result of an event or exposure at work, regardless of whether the injury occurred after normal work hours."
"If an employee strikes his tooth on a pipe stand while performing a task and looses the cap from his tooth, and the dentist replaces it, is it a recordable case?","Replacement of a prosthetic device is not automatically recordable. The case is recordable if medical treatment, such as the use of prescription medication, is needed or if the case involves days away from work or restricted work activity."
"If an employee suffers a Standard Threshold Shift (STS) in only one ear, may the employer revise the baselines for both ears?","No. A Standard Threshold Shift, or STS, is defined in the occupational noise exposure standard at 29 CFR 1910.95(g)(10)(i) as a change in hearing threshold, relative to the baseline audiogram for that employee, of an average of 10 decibels (dB) or more at 2000, 3000, and 4000 hertz (Hz) in one or both ears. The employer is permitted only to revise the baseline in the ear where the employee suffered an STS change in hearing threshold."
"If an employee sustains a work related injury in 2002 and doesn't report it until 2003, which Log should the information be recorded on? Should it be recorded on the 2002 or the 2003 form?",The Injury or illness should be recorded in the year that the incident actually occurred. In this case 2002. You can go back and modify the log for that year and retain it in the files according to the retention regulations.
"If an employee sustains and injury while on a paid break period, is the injury work-related?",Break or pay status does not determine the outcome for recordkeeping. If the employee experienced an injury or illness in the work environment it would be considered work-related unless one of the work-related exceptions applied.
"If an employee voluntarily takes work home and is injured while working at home, is the case recordable?",No. Injuries and illnesses occurring in the home environment are only considered work-related if the employee is being paid or compensated for working at home and the injury or illness is directly related to the performance of the work rather than to the general home environment.
"If an employee was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome and has no restrictions or lost time, would this be recorded on the OSHA log under illness?",Work related carpal tunnel syndrome is only recordable if it entails one or more of the following: medical treatment beyond first aid; days away from work; or days of restricted work activity or job transfer.
"If an employee was injured on the job at 2:00am on 8/5/13, would his Date of Injury be the date his shift started (8/4/2015) or the actual injury date of 8/5/13?",Use the actual date the employee was injured (8/5/2015).
"If an employee was not put on any type of restrictions by a doctor due to a job related injury, but the employer reassigns his/her duties as a precautionary measure, would it be recorded as a restricted duty incident on the 300 log?","Yes, if you assign restricted work activity to an injured or ill worker you must record the case on the Log as a restricted work activity case. The fact that the restriction was put in place for precautionary reasons is not a consideration of whether the case is OSHA recordable."
"If an employee who routinely works ten hours a day is restricted from working more than eight hours following a work-related injury, is the case recordable?","Generally, the employer must record any case in which an employee's work is restricted because of a work-related injury. A work restriction, as defined in section 1904.7(b)(4)(i)(A), occurs when the employer keeps the employee from performing one or more routine functions of the job, or from working the full workday the employee would otherwise have been scheduled to work. The case in question is recordable if the employee would have worked 10 hours had he or she not been injured."
"If an employee who sustains a work-related injury requiring days away from work is terminated for drug use based on the results of a post-accident drug test, how is the case recorded? May the employer stop the day count upon termination of the employee for drug use under section 1904.7(b)(3) (viii)?","Under section 1904.7(b)(3)(viii), the employer may stop counting days away from work if an employee who is away from work because of an injury or illness leaves the company for some reason unrelated to the injury or illness, such as retirement or a plant closing. However, when the employer conducts a drug test based on the occurrence of an accident resulting in an injury at work and subsequently terminates the injured employee, the termination is related to the injury. Therefore, the employer must estimate the number of days that the employee would have been away from work due to the injury and enter that number on the 300 Log."
"If an employee with a recordable work related injury is released to restricted work but the level of restrictions results in no available modified work with the employer, is the time the employee remains out considered days away versus restricted work activity, or since they are released to work at a severely modified level where modified work is not available is it just counted as restricted time?","You must count the days as days away from work. To count days as restricted days, restricted work activity must be made available to the employee."
"If an employee with a work related injury goes to a chiropractor and receives an ""adjustment"" procedure, is this considered ""medical treatment"" under the recordkeeping requirements?","Yes, a chiropractic adjustment procedure is considered medical treatment for OSHA recordkeeping purposes."
"If an employee with a work related injury goes to the hospital and gets stitches, would that be considered a recordable case?",Yes. Sutures are considered medical treatment for OSHA injury and illness recordkeeping purposes.
"If an employee works for a U.S. based company but travels to the Bahamas to do work on behalf of their employer and is injured, is that injury recordable?","Since the injury occurred outside the jurisdictional boundaries of the United States, this is not a recordable injury. The Occupational Safety and Health Act, and therefore the 29 CFR Part 1904 OSHA Recordkeeping Regulation, apply only within the jurisdictional boundaries of the United States and certain locations listed in Section 4(a), 29 USC §653(a) of the Act."
"If an employee works for one of my establishments, but is injured at another of my establishments, the recordable goes on the log of the location where it occurred. How do I account for hours worked in these situations?","When employees work in multiple establishments of the same business, each location can count the employees' hours worked at their establishment towards their total. However, be careful not to double count the employees' hours."
"If an employee's pre-existing medical condition causes an incident which results in a subsequent injury, is the case work-related? For example, if an employee suffers an epileptic seizure, falls, and breaks his arm, is the case covered by the exception in section 1904.5(b)(2)(ii)?","Neither the seizures nor the broken arm are recordable. Injuries and illnesses that result solely from non-work-related events or exposures are not recordable under the exception in section 1904.5(b)(2)(ii). Epileptic seizures are a symptom of a disease of non-occupational origin, and the fact that they occur at work does not make them work-related. Because epileptic seizures are not work-related, injuries resulting solely from the seizures, such as the broken arm in the case in question, are not recordable."
"If an employee, while at work, aggravates a pre-existing condition/injury that was not received in the workplace and receives steroid shots for the pain, even though the employee was already receiving steroid shots for the pre-existing injury, is this a recordable injury?","A preexisting injury or illness has been significantly aggravated, for purposes of OSHA injury and illness recordkeeping, when an event or exposure in the work environment results in a change in medical treatment. If the employee would have received the steroid shot regardless of the aggravation, the case is not recordable. On the other hand, if the employee received the steroid shot because of the aggravation, the case is recordable."
"If an employer has no recordable cases for the year, is an OSHA 300-A, Annual Summary, still required to be completed, certified and posted?","Yes. After the end of the year, employers must review the Log to verify its accuracy, summarize the 300 Log information on the 300A summary form, and certify the summary (a company executive must sign the certification). This information must then be posted for three months, from February 1 to April 30."
"If an injured employee is given a restriction ""Use as tolerated"" or ""Keep injured area clean, dry and covered"", would that injury be recorded as involving days of restriction on the OSHA 300 Log?","Not necessarily. A recommended work restriction is recordable only if it affects one or more of the employee's routine job functions. To determine whether this is the case, you must evaluate the restriction in light of the routine functions of the injured or ill employee's job. If the restriction from you or the physician or other licensed health care professional keeps the employee from performing one or more of his or her routine job functions, or from working the full workday the injured or ill employee would otherwise have worked, the employee's work has been restricted and you must record the case."
If an injured employee is given samples by a doctor but is not given a prescription is this considered medical treatment?,"If the samples given are a prescription medication or are at prescription strength, then it is a medical treatment."
"If an injured worker is formally admitted to the Emergency Room of a hospital, is this a reportable event?","No, the injured worker must be formally admitted to the in-patient service of the hospital to be a reportable event."
"If an injury is recordable with restricted time assigned by a physician, (released to return to work the following day, with restrictions) and the employee decides to miss work due to the injury, am I required to change my OSHA log to reflect a day away?","In this situation, you must count days of restricted work activity as assigned by the physician or other licensed health care professional."
"If an injury occurred in 2002 but days were lost in 2003, how would that be recorded?","You only record the injury or illness once on the log in the year which it occurred. If the employee is still away from work because of the injury or illness when you prepare the annual summary, estimate the total number of calendar days you expect the employee to be away from work, use this number to calculate the total for the annual summary, and then update the initial log entry later when the day count is known or reaches the 180-day cap."
"If employees have a home office that they work from part or most of the time, are they required to complete the annual Form 300?","No, for employees who telecommute from home, the employee's home is not a business establishment and a separate 300 Log is not required.  Recordable injuries and illnesses that occur at the employee's home should be recorded on the Log of the establishment the employee is linked to."
"If employers electronically post the OSHA 300-A Summary of Work-related Injuries and Illnesses, are they in compliance with the posting requirements of 1904.32 (b) (5)?","No. The recordkeeping rule allows all forms to be kept on computer equipment or at an alternate location, as long as the employer can produce the data when needed. Section 1904.32 (b) (5), requires employers to post a copy of the Annual Summary in each establishment, where notices are normally posted [see 1903.2(a)], no later than February 1 of the year following the year covered by the records and kept in place until April 30. Only the OSHA 300-A Summary form should be posted."
"If glue is used to close a wound, is it considered medical treatment or first aid?",The use of surgical glue to close a wound is considered medical treatment.
"If I get a survey form from the BLS, what do I have to do?","If you receive a Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses Form from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), or a BLS designee, you must promptly complete the form and return it, following the instructions contained on the survey form."
"If I had 1 work-related accident but 2 employees were injured, does this get recorded as one or two cases on the OSHA Log?","OSHA's Recordkeeping system tracks work-related recordable injuries and illnesses. If both injuries meet the general recording criteria of Section 1904.7 or the application to specific criteria of Section 1904.8 through Section 1904.11, both cases should be recorded on the Log as two separate cases."
"If I have an employee had lacerations to his hand requiring stitches, would that be an ""other"" recordable case?","Yes. A work related injury requiring stitches must be recorded on the OSHA 300 Log. If the injury did not involve one or more days away from work, one or more days of restricted work, or one or more days of job transfer, you enter a check mark in column J."
"If I have an employee who has a work related incident and the only note from the attending physician is to ""keep the wound clean/dry/covered"", is this considered a restriction and therefore recordable on the 300 Log?","You need to determine if this limitation prevents the employee from performing one or more of his routine job functions. If the employee is unable to perform all of his routine job functions without keeping the wound clean, dry, and covered, then the case involves restricted work activity. If the employee is able to perform all of his routine job functions while keeping the wound clean, dry, and covered then the case does not involve restricted work activity."
"If I have no work related injuries or illnesses in a calendar year, do I still need to complete a form 300 log?","You do not need a completed Form 300. However even if your establishment did not have any OSHA recordable injuries or illnesses, you must still enter zeroes in the total columns on the OSHA form 300A and post the form from February through April."
"If I obtain employees from a temporary help service, employee leasing service, or personnel supply service, do I have to record an injury or illness occurring to one of those employees?",You must record these injuries and illnesses if you supervise these employees on a day-to-day basis.
"If I record an injury and the employee is later diagnosed with an infectious bloodborne disease, do I need to update the OSHA 300 Log?","Yes, you must update the classification of the case on the OSHA 300 Log if the case results in death, days away from work, restricted work, or job transfer. You must also update the description to identify the infectious disease and change the classification"
"If my employee spent the night at the hospital, do I have to report an in-patient hospitalization?",OSHA defines in-patient hospitalization as a formal admission to the in-patient service of a hospital or clinic for care or treatment. An overnight stay does not determine whether the case is reportable or not.
"If my establishment is selected to respond to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Annual Survey, do I have to give the same information to both Agencies?","OSHA and the BLS are working to identify and minimize the burden on employers that are required to respond to both data collections. However, at this time you will need to provide both agencies with the required data through their separate collection vehicles."
If our company has multiple offices in multiple states does each office have to maintain an OSHA 300 Log or should one log for all locations be kept at the Corporate office only?,"You must keep a separate OSHA 300 log for each establishment that is expected to be in operation for one year or longer. You may keep the records for an establishment at your headquarters or other central location if you can: (i) Transmit information about the injuries and illnesses from the establishment to the central location within seven (7) calendar days of receiving information that a recordable injury or illness has occurred; and (ii) Produce and send the records from the central location to the establishment within the time frames required by 1904.35 and 1904.40 when you are required to provide records to a government representative, employees, former employees or employee representatives."
If recording a death do you have to put in the maximum of 180 days away from work in column K?,No. No days away should be entered for a fatality.
"If someone is placed on job transfer or restricted duty, and you can accommodate this light duty only a few days a week, are the other days automatically considered days away from work?","Yes, if you can only accommodate this light duty for a few days a week, the other days are considered days away from work."
"If the Area Office is closed, may I report the fatality, in-patient hospitalization, amputation, or loss of an eye by leaving a message on OSHA's answering machine, faxing the Area Office, or sending an email?","No, if the Area Office is closed, you must report the fatality, in-patient hospitalization, amputation, or loss of an eye using either the 800 number or the reporting application located on OSHA's public Web site atwww.osha.gov."
If the business has multiple locations can the injury & illness recording & reporting form 300 be kept as one large record at the main office or must a form be kept at each location?,"You must have separate records that pertain to each establishment. You may keep the records for an establishment at your headquarters or other central location if you can: (i) Transmit information about the injuries and illnesses from the establishment to the central location within seven (7) calendar days of receiving information that a recordable injury or illness has occurred; and (ii) Produce and send the records from the central location to the establishment within the time frames required by § 1904.35 and § 1904.40 when you are required to provide records to a government representative, employees, former employees or employee representatives."
"If the injured or ill worker produces fewer goods or services than he or she would have produced prior to the injury or illness but otherwise perform all of the routine functions of his or her work, is the case considered a restricted work case?","No, the case is considered restricted work only if the worker does not perform all of the routine functions of his or her job or does not work the full shift that he or she would otherwise have worked."
If there was baby powder on the floor of the ladies restroom at work and someone falls onto the floor due to the baby powder is the incident considered work-related?,"Yes, this case is work-related because it resulted from an event in the work environment."
"If there were no-work related injuries during the year, do I still need to prepare and post a 300-A with no entries on it?","Yes, you still must post the annual summary 300A and enter zeroes for the column totals."
"If we have a contract person working at our site and that person suffers a recordable injury while working, does their employer record the injury on their OSHA 300 log or do we record it on ours?","If the contractor's employee is under the day-to-day supervision of the contractor, the contractor is responsible for recording the injury or illness. If you supervise the contractor employee's work on a day-to-day basis, you must record the injury or illness."
If we have multiple locations - do we keep the OSHA 300 log separately at each location or maintain one log at the main office?,You must keep a separate OSHA 300 Log for each establishment that is expected to be in operation for one year or longer.
"If we submit an workplace injury form to our WC carrier and the injury is DENIED as a workers' comp injury by our carrier, do we still count that injury on our 300 form or do we disregard it?","When an injury or illness occurs to an employee, the employer must independently analyze the case in light of both the OSHA recording criteria and the requirements of the State workers' compensation system to determine whether the case is recordable or compensable, or both. Your case must be judged by the criteria of the OSHA recordkeeping rule to determine if it should be placed on the 300 Log. Workers Compensation is not a consideration of whether the case is OSHA recordable or not."
If you have an injury at work and the employer pays for all the cost without turning this into workers compensation do you have to report the accident on the OSHA log?,"If the injury meets the OSHA recording criteria, you must record it on the OSHA Log regardless of filing for workers compensation. OSHA's recordkeeping requirements and the workers compensation system are two independent systems."
"If you or a physician or other licensed health care professional recommends a work restriction, is the injury or illness automatically recordable as a ""restricted work"" case?","No, a recommended work restriction is recordable only if it affects one or more of the employee's routine job functions. To determine whether this is the case, you must evaluate the restriction in light of the routine functions of the injured or ill employee's job. If the restriction from you or the physician or other licensed health care professional keeps the employee from performing one or more of his or her routine job functions, or from working the full workday the injured or ill employee would otherwise have worked, the employee's work has been restricted and you must record the case."
"In a case where the employee is working restricted duty, and takes days off for personal reasons, do we still include those days in our total?

To do this, the firm will create one registration and follow the directions provided to submit data for multiple establishments. It is important to note that the electronic reporting requirements are for data at the establishment level, not the firm level. The submitted data must be specific for each individual establishment. Note that establishments under state plan jurisdiction must comply with state plan regulations. For more information about the regulations in individual state plans, see here:https://www.osha.gov/dcsp/osp/statestandards.html"
May a third party submit data for an establishment or firm?,"Yes, just as a third party is allowed to maintain the injury and illness records for an employer, a third party is allowed to submit the data for that employer. However, as with recordkeeping, responsibility for the completeness and accuracy of the data lies with the employer, not the third party."
May an employer require post-incident drug testing for an employee who reports a workplace injury or illness?,"The rule does not prohibit drug testing of employees.

"My firm has multiple establishments that do different things. Which determines whether I have to submit data for those establishments, the industry classification of the firm or the industry classification of the establishment?","The electronic reporting requirements are based on the industry classification of the establishment, not the industry classification of the firm. An establishment is defined as a single physical location where business is conducted or where services or industrial operations are performed. A firm may be comprised of one or more establishments. Two groups of establishments are required to electronically submit data to OSHA: (1) Establishments with 20-249 employees in certain industries, and (2) Establishments with 250 or more employees in industries subject to OSHA's recordkeeping requirement.

"On the 300 form do I only put recordable cases, or do I also put in accidents like small cuts and burns that did not need any medical attention besides band aids?","Only enter recordable cases on the OSHA Log. Do not enter cases that do not meet the recording criteria, such as first aid cases."
"On the OSHA 300 form, there is a line at the bottom of the page that says Page Totals. If your OSHA 300 log is more than one page long, should those page totals be cumulative including totals from previous page?","The totals at the bottom of the page are meant to reflect the totals for the individual page. However, if a cumulative total better meets your needs, you may enter the cumulative total."
"On the OSHA Form 300, under category (J)what does Other recordable cases mean?","Column J on the OSHA 300 Form is for injuries and illnesses that meet the recording criteria but do not involve death, days away from work or job transfer/restriction.

"One of our employees sustained an injury and received restrictions from our medical provider. Her work group rotates assignments monthly. She is able to fulfill all the job functions of her current assignment, and her restrictions will be lifted before a rotation is due. If she was at a different place in the job rotation she would not be able to perform all essential job functions.  Her injury is recorded on our OSHA 300 Log. Should we also be logging the restricted days on the 300 log, even though she performs all essential functions of her current assignment?","Yes.

Subsequently it has been determined that she requires surgery for the injury. She has had surgery to correct this problem and will be out for approximately 5 days. Do I record the case using the initial accident date and then record the days out of work due to the surgery even though this was originally a non-recordable incident?,"Yes. When known, you use the date the injury occurred even though it may not have been recordable at that time."
Our business manufactures fishing tackle. We occasionally have an employee whose finger gets punctured by a fish hook while assembling the lure. We are sometimes able to get the hook out by one of our staff; other times it is necessary to have the hook removed by a doctor. What are some guidelines we might use to determine if this type of injury is recordable or not?,"Removing foreign material from areas other than the eye by irrigation, tweezers, cotton swabs or other simple means is considered first aid and does not make a case recordable. Removal of a fish hook by surgical or other complicated means is medical treatment and would make a case recordable. The issuance of prescription medication to prevent infection would also make the case recordable."
Our business operates two production facilities (appx 40 miles apart). Should we be keeping a separate 300 log for both facilities?,"Yes, you should keep separate OSHA logs for each facility. A single log can be kept for multiple locations only when they are located in close proximity to each other. For example, two buildings within a block of each other can have a single log. On the other hand, two buildings separated by a mile or more must have two separate logs."
Our company has experienced two minor injuries that resulted in a positive drug screen following our post accident testing program.

"Recently we had an employee suffer from a small (2 cm) second degree burn. The individual was seen by a doctor who cleaned the area, applied an over the counter ointment and returned him to work. He was instructed to obtain and utilize an over the counter ointment and to keep the area covered. The doctor gave him no work restrictions. Is this recordable?","No, the size or degree of a work-related burn does not determine recordability.

"Recently we had an employee that while working in her designated work area, was bitten by a spider. The employee was taken to the doctor where she was given a tetanus shot and an antibiotic prescription as preventative against an infection.

"Section 1904.7(b)(5)(ii) of the rule defines first aid, in part, as ""removing splinters or foreign material from areas other than the eye by irrigation, tweezers, cotton swabs or other simple means."" What are ""other simple means"" of removing splinters that are considered first aid?","""Other simple means"" of removing splinters, for purposes of the first-aid definition, means methods that are reasonably comparable to the listed methods. Using needles, pins or small tools to extract splinters would generally be included."
"Sense a tetanus immunization is a preventative medication and is not considered medical treatment for recordkeeping purposes, are other preventative medications first aid or medical treatment? For example if a person is bitten by a dog and the Physician gives prescription antibiotics as a preventive measure, is the case recordable?","Tetanus shots, are specifically listed in the regulation as first aid. Any other prescription medication is considered medical treatment. The preventive, precautionary or prophylactic nature of a medication is not controlling for OSHA recordability.

"Since the new system proposes to do away with the distinction between injuries and illnesses, is there guidance on how to classify cases to complete column M on the OSHA 300 Log?","An injury or illness is an abnormal condition or disorder. Employers should look at the examples of injuries and illnesses in the ""Classifying Injuries and Classifying Illnesses"" section of the Recordkeeping Forms Package for guidance. If still unsure about the classification, employers could use the longstanding distinction between injuries that result from instantaneous events or those from exposures in the work environment. Cases resulting from anything other than an instantaneous event or exposure are considered illnesses"
Six employees were returning to the office from a trade show that they were working at. They were involved in a traffic accident where the van they were riding in was struck by another car. Several of the employees required medical treatment. Would we need to record the 4 people that received medical treatment?,"Yes. Because the employees were traveling in the interest of the employer, the accident is work related. The employees that required medical treatment must be recorded on the Log."
"Some employees work on an off-Friday. The company furnishes lunch for these occasions. An employee was consuming the lunch while at their work-station, and bit on an olive pit. The employee's tooth was broken.

Note, if the employee is made ill by ingesting food contaminated by workplace contaminants (such as lead), or gets food poisoning from food supplied by the employer, the case would be considered work-related."
Some of my employees work at several different locations or do not work at any of my establishments at all. How do I record cases for these employees?,"You must link each of your employees with one of your establishments, for recordkeeping purposes. You must record the injury and illness on the OSHA 300 Log of the injured or ill employee's establishment, or on an OSHA 300 Log that covers that employee's short-term establishment."
Some of my employees work in the field and never report to my physical establishment. Do I have to send these workers a copy of the Summary Form 300A to meet the posting requirements?,"No. You are only required to post the summary at the physical establishment that the log is linked to. There are no additional requirements that you reach out to workers who do not physically report to the site. If a worker requests access to the summary, you need to provide it as required by 1904.35(b)(2) of the rule. You certainly are not prohibited from providing these workers a copy of the summary through additional means (e.g. by mailing or e-mailing a copy directly to each worker) if you choose to do so."
"The day the employee was injured the doctor released him off work for that same day. Would I count this 1 day under the ""away from work"" section in the Form 300?","No. You begin counting the number of calendar days for days away from work, restricted work or job transfer on the day after the injury occurred or illness began."
The employee ended his shift and went to the locker room to change into his street clothes. His foot got caught in his pants leg causing him to fall over at an odd angle. When this occurred the associate broke his small toe. Would this be considered a recordable case?,"The case is not recordable, it meets the exception to work relatedness under 1904.5(b)(2)(vi). The exception in 29 CFR 1904.5(b) (2) (vi) states that an injury or illness is not considered work-related if it is solely the result of personal grooming. If, on the other hand, the employee was required to change his clothes because of exposure to a workplace contaminant, the case would be considered work-related and recordable."
"The old rule required the recording of all occupational illnesses, regardless of severity. For example, a work-related skin rash was recorded even if it didn't result in medical treatment. Does the rule still capture these minor illness cases?","No. Under the new rule, injuries and illnesses are recorded using the same criteria. As a result, some minor illness cases are no longer recordable. For example, a case of work-related skin rash is now recorded only if it results in days away from work, restricted work, transfer to another job, or medical treatment beyond first aid."
There is a fight between two employees in a plant over a personal matter in the rest room and one is injured. Is this work related?,"Yes. You must consider an injury to be work-related if an event or exposure in the work environment either caused or contributed to the resulting condition or significantly aggravated a pre-existing injury or illness. Work-relatedness is presumed for injuries and illnesses resulting from events or exposures occurring in the work environment, unless an exception in § 1904.5(b)(2) specifically applies. There is no exception for work-place violence or horseplay."
There was an injury that occurred in the workplace that involved horseplay. Is this OSHA work-related?,"Yes. If an event occurs at work, the case is work-related unless it otherwise falls within an exception. There is no exemption for horseplay."
"This question involves the following sequence of events: Employee A drives to work, parks her car in the company parking lot and is walking across the lot when she is struck by a car driven by employee B, who is commuting to work. Both employees are seriously injured in the accident. Is either case work-related?","Neither employee's injuries are recordable. While the employee parking lot is part of the work environment under section 1904.5, injuries occurring there are not work-related if they meet the exception in section 1904.5(b)(2)(vii). Section 1904.5(b)(2)(vii) excepts injuries caused by motor vehicle accidents occurring on the company parking lot while the employee is commuting to and from work. In the case in question, both employees' injuries resulted from a motor vehicle accident in the company parking lot while the employees were commuting. Accordingly, the exception applies."
"To record a case as lost time, is a doctor's note required?","A doctor's note is not required to record a case as a case involving ""Days away from work"". When a medical opinion does not exist you must base the classification on the employer's assignment of days away from work. If you determine the employee needed time for recuperation and assigned days away from work, then you would record the case as a case involving days away from work."
"Two office workers go off site from the office to have lunch. While there personal vehicle is waiting at a near-by red light, they are struck by another vehicle. The employees were examined at the ER and released. One employee received prescription strength medication. Should this injury be recorded?","The automobile accident is not work-related and the injury is not recordable. Injuries and illnesses that occur to employees who are not in the work environment and are not engaged in work activities ""in the interest of the employer"" are not considered work related."
"Under 1904, is an injury considered work related if an employee slips and falls on ice in the company's parking lot while walking between their automobile and the facility and prior to the start and/or after the end of their normal workday?","Parking Lots are considered part of the employers establishment. Punching in or out of a time clock does not determine the outcome for work-relatedness. Because none of the work-related exceptions under 1904.5(b)(2) apply to the event, the case is work related."
"Under paragraph 1904.29(b)(9), the employer may use some discretion in describing a privacy concern case on the log so the employee cannot be identified. Can the employer also leave off the job title, date, or where the event occurred?","Yes. OSHA believes that this would be an unusual circumstance and that leaving this information off the log will rarely be needed. However, if the employer has reason to believe that the employee's name can be identified through this information, these fields can be left blank."
"Under the record keeping requirements, employers with less than 11 employees are not required to complete OSHA logs. If an employer had 2 employees and 15 volunteers both performing similar job tasks, would they be required to complete OSHA logs?","The small employer exemption is based on the number of employees of the firm. If the ""volunteers"" do not meet the definition of employee in the OSH Act, then the firm meets the small employer exemption."
"Upon reporting to work, an employee slips on an icy patch of the parking lot falls and injures a knee. The injury results in 23 days of restricted duty. Since the incident occurred in the employee parking lot, would this be a recordable injury?",The case is work related and recordable. An injury or illness is work-related if an event or exposure in the work environment either caused or contributed to the resulting condition or significantly aggravated a pre-existing injury or illness. The company parking lot is part of the work-environment.
"Upon returning to the office following his morning rounds, our employee felt a strange sensation on his shoulder and left side. He brushed his shirt with his hand and a spider fell to the floor. The employee was immediately sent to a nearby medical facility, for evaluation and treatment if necessary. The treating physician's examination did not reveal any indication of a spider bite where our employee thought he had been bitten.  As a precaution, the treating physician administered antibiotics to our employee. Our employee never experienced any adverse reaction in the area of where he thought he was bitten. Is this recordable?","No. If there is no indication that an injury occurred, the case should not be recorded."
"We are 1 entity but have 3 different facilities. When completing the OSHA log, do we report all 3 yards together as 1 or do we report each yard separately?","You must maintain a set of OSHA forms (including the 300A) for each individual establishment. An employer may combine two or more physical locations into a single establishment only when: 1) The employer operates the locations as a single business operation under common management; 2) The locations are all located in close proximity to each other; and 3) The employer keeps one set of business records for the locations, such as records on the number of employees, their wages and salaries, sales or receipts, and other kinds of business information. For example, one manufacturing establishment might include the main plant, a warehouse a few blocks away, and an administrative services building across the street."
"We are a general contractor and hire supplemental craft and supervisory employees from a firm that supplies temporary help. One of the employees had a recordable injury. He was directly supervised by our employee. My understanding of the recordkeeping requirement is that the injury would be entered on our log, not the temporary help company, since we control and direct the employee's work. Am I correct?","Yes. You must record the recordable injuries and illnesses that occur to employees who are not on your payroll if you supervise these employees on a day to day basis.  Day to day supervision occurs when in addition to specifying the output, product or result to be accomplished by the person's work, the employer supervises the details, means, methods and processes by which the work is to be accomplished."
We are a government contractor whose employees are located in several different buildings on a large government site. Do I need to complete a separate Form 300 for each building where the employees are located? Or can I just complete one for all the employees and distribute and post accordingly?,You may treat a campus location as a single establishment and keep one log for that location.
"We are a hospital. Under our umbrella, there are numerous physician clinics and practices. My understanding is the physician clinics are not required to maintain the 300 log. Is this correct?","The partial industry classification exemption applies to individual business establishments. If a company has several business establishments engaged in different business activities, some of the company's establishments may be required to keep records, while others may be partially exempt. If the physician offices and clinics (NAICS code 6211) are separate locations from the hospital, they would be partially exempted from maintaining the OHSA recordkeeping forms under part 1904.2."
We are a prime contractor that provides day-to-day-supervision to subcontractor workers. We record the injuries to these workers on our OSHA log. Do we include the man-hours of the subcontractor workers in with our numbers?,Yes. Your figure for hours worked should include the time for all workers whose injuries and illnesses are recordable on your log.
"We employ many temporary, seasonal and part time employees. If one of them has a work related accident, how do I record lost time on the OSHA log?","Estimate the total number of calendar days you expect the employee to be away from work, and then update the initial log entry later when the actual day count is known. If you are unable to track the recovery of the temporary worker, and you have a recommendation from a health care provider, use the recommended amount of days as the day count. If a recommendation from a health care provider is not available, enter a good faith estimate as the day count."
We found a duplicate incident on our OSHA 300 for year 2015. Who can we contact to correct the error?,"If you have a duplicate incident on your OSHA 300 form, you may delete the duplicate case. Please be aware that OSHA currently does not have the information from these forms in our possession. Employers retain the forms at their premises and OSHA accesses the information during inspections."
We had a employee that was stung by a bee and went into anaphylactic shock. Would this be considered an injury or a respiratory condition for the Form 300?,Insect bites and stings are classified as injuries on the OSHA Form 300.
"We had a minor chemical spill in WV. As a precautionary measure, we instructed our employees to go to the hospital/emergency room to get their lungs checked out. No problems were found and treatment was necessary. Are these considered recordable?","No. To be recordable on the OSHA log an injury or illness must exist. Exposures without signs or symptoms of the illness are not recordable, even if medical treatment is administered. Also, visits to a physician or other licensed health care professional solely for observation or counseling is not considered medical treatment and does not make a case recordable."
We had an associate sustain a contusion and minor abrasion to the right hand (no bleeding). The associate was treated with first aid by our on-site medical provider and sent back to work. Approximately 2 weeks later the associate returned to on-site medical with a swelled hand and pain. He was immediately sent to the doctor and given an antibiotic for infection. The doctor stated that the infection may have come from the associate not properly treating the abrasion. Is this now a recordable case even though it was caused by improper care which is out of our control?,"Yes, this is a recordable injury because the infection resulted from the work-related abrasion. The fact that it is partially due to improper treatment is not a consideration for recordability."
We had an employee conducting office work that was simply walking to another employee's cubicle during which she twisted her foot and sustained a fracture. The investigation revealed that there were no physical conditions or factors associated to the work environment or activity that contributed to the accident other than the fact that she was walking. Is this case work related?,"Yes, this case is considered work-related. You must consider an injury or illness to be work-related if an event or exposure in the work environment either caused or contributed to the resulting condition. This employee twisted her ankle in the work environment."
We had an employee fall and chip a tooth. He went to the dentist and had a small cap placed on the tooth. Is this considered a recordable injury?,Yes. A case involving a chipped or broken tooth is considered a significant injury when diagnosed by a physician or other health care professional. Work-related significant injuries are automatically recordable.
"We had an employee get hurt and put on restricted duty by the doctor, but he chose to go home instead of doing the restricted work we had lined up for him. Does that make the case a lost time case?","Record the case as a case involving restricted work activity. You should classify the case based upon the doctor's recommendation of restricted work, as long as you make the restricted work available to the employee."
"We had an employee get hurt and put on restricted duty, but he chose to go home instead of doing the restricted work we had lined up for him. Does that make the case a case with days away or do we just count the days of restricted duty that the doctor gave him?","In this situation, you record the case as a case involving restricted work activity and enter the count of days recommended by the physician or other licensed health care professional."
We had an incident where an employee was working with a hammer and chisel and hit his hand and received a small injury. He removed his glove and saw a small cut with some blood. When he saw the blood he fainted and fell on the platform where he hit with his head on the grating. This resulted in a cut in his head which needed two stitches. The man explained that he always has this problem when he has an injury and sees his own blood. Is this recordable?,"Yes, this is a recordable injury. The fainting and head laceration would not have occurred but for the work-related hand injury. The employee's loss of consciousness and resulting head injury are a direct consequence of an event in the work-environment."
"We had two injury incidents occur recently. The injuries were a bone chip to the end of a finger, and a depression in the bone of a finger. The physicians called the injuries a ""tuft fracture"" and a ""divot fracture"". In these instances the bone chip and the divot injury were deemed ""minor"" injuries by the attending physicians. The employees were returned to full duties without any treatment beyond first aid treatment. The individuals were able to complete all of their normal duties. Are these recordable?","Yes, all work related fractures are recordable."
We have a long time employee who had a positive reaction to a mantoux for the first time this year (she has worked for us several years). We have no knowledge of this employee being exposed to active TB in the workplace. As yet the employee has not contracted TB. Is this recordable on the OSHA log?,No. There has to be occupational exposure to someone with a known case of active tuberculosis (TB) to establish work-relationship.
We have a main office a four branch offices. Do I only have to post the summary form in my main office or do I need to post in all offices?,You need to keep a separate OSHA 300 Log for each establishment and post the summary in each establishment.
We have a zero tolerance policy for drug use and any employee testing positive for drugs from random or post accident or reasonable cause is grounds for immediate dismissal. If we have an employee injured on the job that results in days away and they test positive for drugs at the time of the accident do we need to report this as a lost time on the 300 log if they are terminated for using an illegal substance?,Yes. You must estimate the number of days that the employee would have been away from work due to the injury and enter that number on the 300 Log. The drug test and subsequent termination are related to the injury and cannot be used to stop the day count.
"We have an employee that was injured on the job 2/23 and has been working light duty, within his restrictions ever since. While working light duty, he was injured on the job again (different injury and body part) on 4/08. We have light duty within the restrictions for the initial injury, but we cannot provide light duty within the restriction of the second injury, resulting in days away from work. How should we record the time for the initial injury and the second injury in accordance with OSHA recording regulations?","Stop the count of the days of restricted work activity for the first case, and enter the second injury as a new case and record the number of days away from work."
We have an employee who developed a rash from using Latex gloves. She went to the doctor and received a prescription cream. Is this recordable?,Yes. The case is recordable because of the use of prescription cream. Latex allergic reactions would be considered an illness and have a check mark in column M 2.
"We have an employee who had a job related injury, which resulted in work restrictions. As is required by our Company, he had to submit to a post injury drug test, and the drug test came back positive.  Do we still need to record this on our 301 log, even though it did result in a positive drug test?","Yes. You must consider an injury or illness to be work-related if an event or exposure in the work environment either caused or contributed to the resulting condition or significantly aggravated a pre-existing injury or illness. Work-relatedness is presumed for injuries and illnesses resulting from events or exposures occurring in the work environment, unless an exception in § 1904.5(b)(2) specifically applies. There is no exception for alcohol or drug impairment under 1904.5(b)(2)."
We have an employee who normally work seven 8 hour days each week. As a result of an injury the employee was limited to working five 8 hour days per week. Would this be a lost workday case since he was still able to work 40 hours per week?,Yes. You must count each overtime day missed as a day of away from work.
"We have an employee who was injured on 9-13. He remained at work. On 9-14 he left work during the day to seek medical treatment. The doctor advised him that he was to remain off work until 9-18. It turns out that this employee was going to be laid off starting 9-15, as this was decided prior to this incident occurring. Would this be considered a days away case?",This is a recordable case involving restricted work activity. The employee was unable to complete the 9/14 shift. Days away are not recorded because the employee was laid off for reasons unrelated to the injury prior to days away occurring.
"We have an employee who was injured on the job, and returned to 'restricted' duty. We no longer have work available that meets his restrictions and we will have to lay him off. Will he now be considered as being on 'lost time' due to the fact that we are laying him off because we no longer have restricted work available?","Yes, because you cannot meet the restrictions, the case involves days away from work. You must estimate the total number of days away the employee would need to recuperate and enter the day count on the 300 Log."
We have an employee who was laid-off for economic reasons while on restricted duty. Do I count the lay-off days as restricted days on the OSHA 300 log?,"You do not need to count the days the employee was laid off. If the employee leaves your company for some reason unrelated to the injury or illness, such as retirement, a plant closing, or to take another job, you may stop counting days away from work or days of restriction/job transfer. If an employee leaves your company because of the injury or illness, you must estimate the total number of days away or days of restriction/job transfer and enter the day count on the 300 Log."
"We have an employee who was requested to come back to modified work but refused. As a result, we have terminated his employment. Is the time subsequent to his termination now considered ""days away"" that we need to document on the log?",No. You may count the days the employee would have needed to fully recuperate as days of restricted work activity.
We have employees who go into client homes. We just had an employee exposed to Whooping Cough. It was suggested that they take antibiotics although they didn't exhibit symptoms. Do we need to record this case?,"No. To be recordable on the OSHA log an injury or illness must exist. Exposures without signs or symptoms of the illness are not recordable, even if medical treatment is administered."
"We have multiple locations, in Iowa, West Virginia, and Alabama,. Are we required to maintain the OSHA recordkeeping forms at each of these locations?","Yes, you must keep a separate OSHA 300 Log for each establishment that is expected to be in operation for one year or longer. You may keep the records for an establishment at your headquarters or other central location if you can: (i) Transmit information about the injuries and illnesses from the establishment to the central location within seven (7) calendar days of receiving information that a recordable injury or illness has occurred; and (ii) Produce and send the records from the central location to the establishment within the time frames required by 1904.35 and 1904.40 when you are required to provide records to a government representative, employees, former employees or employee representatives."
"We have several part-time employees that have sustained an injury and are instructed to be out of work from their healthcare provider. Due to the fact that the employees do not have a regular work schedule and are called in on an as needed basis, how do we count the days off?","You must count days away from work using calendar days regardless of whether the employee was scheduled to work on those days or not. This applies to employees who work on a part-time or an as needed basis. For example, if the licensed healthcare professional recommended 10 days away from work, you would count 10 consecutive days. OSHA requires employers to use the physician's or Health Care Professional's recommendation as the day count when recording a case. If the healthcare provider did not specify a specific time period, you may end the count of days away from work when the employee is capable to return."
"We share a large, high-rise building with other tenants. Our offices are on the 18-23 floor of a 35-story building. The bottom 2 floors of the building are common areas for all tenants and visitors, and not under our company's' direct control.  An employee was entering the building common area, and fell just as they entered the door threshold. . The employee sustained some injuries, and medical treatment was given. Should we consider this common area as part of the "" employers establishment""? Is this injury work related?",The common area of a shared building is not considered part of your work environment. This case is not considered work related and therefore not recordable.
We use many volunteer workers here at our place of business. Are injuries related to their work recordable on the OSHA log?,"You are required to record injuries and illnesses of ""employees"" as defined by the OSH Act and Part 1904.31. Generally injuries and illnesses to volunteers that do not receive any compensation are not recordable on the OSHA log."
"What activities are considered ""personal grooming"" for purposes of the exception to the geographic presumption of work-relatedness in section 1904.5(b)(2)(vi)?","Personal grooming activities are activities directly related to personal hygiene, such as combing and drying hair, brushing teeth, clipping fingernails and the like. Bathing or showering at the workplace when necessary because of an exposure to a substance at work is not within the personal grooming exception in section 1904.5(b)(2)(vi). Thus, if an employee slips and falls while showering at work to remove a contaminant to which he has been exposed at work, and sustains an injury that meets one of the general recording criteria listed in section 1904.7(b)(1), the case is recordable"
"What are ""assigned working hours"" for purposes of the exception to the geographic presumption in section 1904.5(b)(2)(v)?","""Assigned working hours,"" for purposes of section 1904.5(b)(2)(v), means those hours the employee is actually expected to work, including overtime."
"What are ""personal tasks"" for purposes of the exception to the geographic presumption in section 1904.5(b)(2)(v)?","""Personal tasks"" for purposes of section 1904.5(b)(2)(v) are tasks that are unrelated to the employee's job. For example, if an employee uses a company break area to work on his child's science project, he is engaged in a personal task."
What date should be used for an injury that is reported on January 31 and does not become a recordable injury until February 5th. Would this be counted as recordable for the month of January when the injury occurred or in February when it became recordable?,"You should record the injury using the date the injury occurred, January 31st."
"What do I do if a physician or other licensed health care professional recommends a job restriction meeting OSHA's definition, but the employee does all of his or her routine job functions anyway?","You must record the injury or illness on the OSHA 300 Log as a restricted work case. If a physician or other licensed health care professional recommends a job restriction, you should ensure that the employee compiles with that restriction. If you receive recommendations from two or more physicians or other licensed health care professionals, you may make a decision as to which recommendation is the most authoritative, and record the case based upon that recommendation."
"What does ""other potentially infectious material"" mean?","The term ""other potentially infectious materials"" is defined in the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens standard at § 1910.1030(b). These materials include: Human bodily fluids, tissues and organs, and other materials infected with the HIV or hepatitis B (HBV) virus such as laboratory cultures or tissues from experimental animals."
What does EMR stand for and where can I get it?,"EMR stands for Experience Modification Rate, a term used in Workers Compensation systems in determining insurance premiums. Please contact your State's Workers Compensation Agency or your insurance carrier to get your rate."
What does it mean to be partially exempt from keeping OSHA injury and illness records?,"If your establishment is in a NAICS industry that is included in the new list, you will not have to keep OSHA injury and illness records unless you are asked to do so in writing by OSHA, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or a state agency operating under the authority of OSHA or BLS. However, if a fatality, in-patient hospitalization, amputation, or loss of an eye occurs at your establishment due to a work-related incident, you will still be required to report the event to OSHA, per 29 CFR 1904.39. For more information about this reporting requirement, see Reporting Fatalities and Severe Injuries/Illnesses."
What if a physician or other licensed care professional recommends medical treatment but the employee does not follow the recommendation?,"If a physician or other licensed health care professional recommend medical treatment, you should encourage the injured or ill employee to follow that recommendation. However, you must record the case even if the injured or ill employee does not follow the physician or other licensed health care professional's recommendation."
What if an employee slips in the parking lot as he or she is coming into work in the morning? Would that be considered work-related?,Yes. An injury or illness is work-related if an event or exposure in the work environment either caused or contributed to the resulting condition or significantly aggravated a pre-existing injury or illness. The company parking lot is part of the work environment.
"What if I don't learn about a reportable fatality, in-patient hospitalization, amputation, or loss of an eye right away? Or what if I cannot determine that it was work-related right away?","You must report to OSHA within the following time period after the fatality, in-patient hospitalization, amputation, or loss of an eye is reported to you or to any of your agent(s) and you determine that it is work-related: 8 hours for a fatality, and 24 hours for an in-patient hospitalization, an amputation, or a loss of an eye."
"What if I don't learn right away that the reportable fatality, in-patient hospitalization, amputation, or loss of an eye was the result of a work-related incident?","If you do not learn right away that the reportable fatality, in-patient hospitalization, amputation, or loss of an eye was the result of a work-related incident, you must make the report to OSHA within the following time period after you or any of your agent(s) learn that the reportable fatality, in-patient hospitalization, amputation, or loss of an eye was the result of a work-related incident: Eight (8) hours for a fatality, and twenty-four (24) hours for an inpatient hospitalization, an amputation, or a loss of an eye."
What if one of the employee is splashed or exposed to blood or other potentially infectious material without being cut or scratched?,"Do I need to record this incident? You need to record such an incident on the OSHA 300 Log as an illness if: It results in the diagnosis of a bloodborne illness, such as HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C; or It meets one or more of the recording criteria in § 1904.7."
"What if the fatality, in-patient hospitalization, amputation, or loss of an eye does not occur during or right after the work-related incident?","If a fatality occurs within 30 days of the work-related incident, or if an in-patient hospitalization, amputation, or loss of an eye occurs within 24 hours of the work-related incident, then you must report the event to OSHA. If the fatality occurs after more than 30 days of the work-related incident, or if the in-patient hospitalization, amputation, or loss of an eye occurs after more than 24 hours after the work-related incident, then you do not have to report the event to OSHA. However, you must record the event on your OSHA injury and illness records, if you are required to keep OSHA injury and illness records."
"What is ""first aid""?","For the purposes of Part 1904, ""first aid"" means the following: Using a non-prescription medication at nonprescription strength for medications available in both prescription and non-prescription form, a recommendation by a physician or other licensed health care professional to use a non-prescription medication at prescription strength is considered medical treatment for recordkeeping purposes); Administering tetanus immunizations (other immunizations, such as Hepatitis B vaccine or rabies vaccine, are considered medical treatment); Cleaning, flushing or soaking wounds on the surface of the skin; Using wound covering such as bandages, Band-Aids , gauze pads, etc.; or using butterfly bandages or Steri-Strips (other wound closing devices such as sutures, staples, etc., are considered medical treatment); Using hot or cold therapy; Using any non-rigid means of support, such as elastic bandages, wraps, non-rigid back belts, etc. (devices with rigid stay or other systems designed to immobilize parts of the body are considered medical treatment for recordkeeping purposes); Using temporary immobilization devices while transporting an accident victim (e.g., splints, slings, neck collars, back boards, etc.); Drilling of a fingernail or toenail to relieve pressure, or draining fluid from a blister; Removing splinters or foreign material from areas other than the eye by irrigation, tweezers, cotton swabs or other simple means; Using finger guards; Using massages (physical therapy or chiropractic treatment are considered medical treatment for recordkeeping purposes); or Drinking fluids for relief of heat stress."
"What is a ""significant"" diagnosed injury or illness that is recordable under the general criteria even if it does not result in death, days away from work, restricted work or job transfer, medical treatment beyond first aid, or loss of consciousness?","Work-related cases involving cancer, chronic irreversible disease, a fractured or cracked bone, or a punctured eardrum must always be recorded under the general criteria at the time of diagnosis by a physician or other licensed health care professional."
What is a Standard Threshold Shift?,"A Standard Threshold Shift, or STS, is defined in the occupational noise exposure standard at 29 CFR 1910.95(g)(10)(i) as a change in hearing threshold, relative to the baseline audiogram for that employee, of an average of 10 decibels (dB) or more at 2000, 3000, and 4000 hertz (Hz) in one or both ears."
What is an equivalent form?,"An equivalent form is one that has the same information, is as readable and understandable, and is completed using the same instructions as the OSHA form it replaces. Many employers use an insurance form instead of the OSHA 301 Incident Report, or supplement an insurance form by adding any additional information required by OSHA."
"What is considered a ""construction work zone"" for purposes of section 1904.39(b)(3)?","A ""construction work zone"" for purposes of §1904.39(b)(3) is an area of a street or highway where construction activities are taking place, and is typically marked by signs, channeling devices, barriers, pavement markings and/or work vehicles. The work zone extend from the first warning sign or rotating/strobe lights on a vehicle to the ""END ROAD WORK"" sign or the last temporary traffic control device."

Employers are not required to remove any arc-proofing tape, duct - 30 - work, concrete, asphalt, or similar material that may be covering the energized cables as part of the required inspection before moving the energized cables. If any of the abnormalities listed in 29 CFR 1910.269(t)(7)(i) and 29 CFR 1926.965(h)(1) are found during the work, the abnormalities must be treated as an indication of an impending fault.","OSHA does not anticipate that employers will find that employees performing the inspections required by 29 CFR 1910.269(t)(6) and 29 CFR 1926.965(g) are exposed to electric arc hazards. However, the employer must still conduct the assessment required by 29 CFR 1910.269(l)(8)(i) and 29 CFR 1926.960(g)(1) to determine if the employees performing such inspections are exposed to hazards from flames or from electric arcs; and, if the assessment reveals an electric arc hazard, the employer must make the incident energy estimate required by 29 CFR 1910.269(l)(8)(ii) and 29 CFR 1926.960(g)(2)."
Will OSHA deem an employee to be drop starting a saw simply because the employee starts the saw in a manner that involves some bend in the employee’s arm?,Will OSHA deem an employee to be drop starting a saw simply because the employee starts the saw in a manner that involves some bend in the employee’s arm?
Does 29 CFR 1910.269(r)(5) apply only to gasoline-engine power saws used for lineclearance tree trimming work covered by 29 CFR 1910.269?,"Yes, 29 CFR 1910.269(r)(5) applies only to gasoline-engine power saws used for work covered by 29 CFR 1910.269(r). See 29 CFR 1910.269(a)(1)(i)(E) (scope) and 29 CFR 1910.269(x) (definition of “line-clearance tree trimming”). Standards other than 29 CFR 1910.269 and 29 CFR Part 1926, Subpart V, or the General Duty Clause of the OSH Act, may govern other power saw operations."
"Appendix C (Protection from Hazardous Differences in Electric Potential) to both 29 CFR 1910.269 and 29 CFR Part 1926, Subpart V sets out methods the employer may use to establish an equipotential zone. Are these the only methods the employer may use?","No. Appendix C is nonmandatory. Employers may set their own grounding practices without following the guidelines in Appendix C, but the Agency reminds employers that 29 CFR 1910.269(n)(3) and 29 CFR 1926.962(c) require them to be able to demonstrate that any practices selected will prevent each employee from being exposed to hazardous differences in electric potential. OSHA will deem grounding practices meeting Appendix C as complying with these paragraphs."
"Does fall protection equipment used in this manner meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.269(g)(2)(iv)(C)(3) and 1910.269(g)(2)(iv)(D), and 29 CFR 1926.954(b)(3)(iii)(C) and 1926.954(b)(3)(iv)?","Yes, provided that the equipment is rigged so that the employee can be supported on an elevated vertical surface and can work with both hands free while leaning and the - 25 - equipment complies with other applicable requirements for work-positioning equipment, including the anchorage strength requirement and the requirement for the system to be rigged so that the employee can free fall no more than 0.6 meters (2 feet).Yes, provided that the equipment is rigged so that the employee can be supported on an elevated vertical surface and can work with both hands free while leaning and the - 25 - equipment complies with other applicable requirements for work-positioning equipment, including the anchorage strength requirement and the requirement for the system to be rigged so that the employee can free fall no more than 0.6 meters (2 feet)."
Some steel poles have clips or studs to secure detachable ladders to the pole. May employers use these types of ladders as anchorages?,"Yes, provided the employer relies on recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices, with consideration given to such factors as design specifications and maintenance procedures, in determining whether potential anchorages meet the strength requirements in 29 CFR 1910.269(g)(2)(iv)(E), 29 CFR 1926.954(b)(3)(v), and 29 CFR 1926.502(d)(15), and provided the employer ensures that a visual inspection by the employee before use reveals that nothing about the appearance of the anchorage (for example, corrosion or cracks in the clips or studs or in any welds holding them in place) suggests that the applicable strength criteria would not be met."
"Does OSHA consider a tower leg, cross bracing, or lattice work to be a “lower level” for purposes of this provision?","No. OSHA does not treat a tower leg, cross bracing, or lattice work of a type commonly found on a tower, a substation structure, or a similar structure as a lower level for purposes of assessing compliance with 29 CFR 1926.502(d)(16)(iii), as incorporated in 29 CFR 1910.269(g)(2)(iv)(B) and 29 CFR 1926.954(b)(3)(ii)."
Does OSHA consider a tree branch or a utility line conductor or cable to be a “lower level” for purposes of this provision?,"No. OSHA does not treat a tree branch or utility line conductor or cable as a lower level for purposes of assessing compliance with 29 CFR 1926.502(d)(16)(iii), as incorporated in 29 CFR 1910.269(g)(2)(iv)(B) and 29 CFR 1926.954(b)(3)(ii)."
"Under 29 CFR 1910.269(l)(8)(ii) and 29 CFR 1926.960(g)(2), for each employee exposed to electric arc hazards, employers must “make a reasonable estimate of the incident heat energy to which the employee would be exposed.” If an employer has more than one generating plant, are estimates required for each plant, or is the employer permitted to prepare an estimate for one generating plant and use it for other plants?","The employer is not necessarily required to prepare estimates for each individual generating plant. The employer may apply an estimate conducted for one generating plant to another generating plant as long as either: (1) the estimate is for a plant that is equivalent, in all respects that could affect available incident energy, to the other plants at which the estimate will be applied; or (2) the estimate is for a plant that is reasonably expected to have incident heat energy exposures higher than those at the other plants at which the estimate will be applied. The employer must ensure that the estimate is reasonable for a given generating plant before applying it to that location."
What protection is addressed in Section 11(c) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act?,"Section 11(c) of the Act is the antidiscrimination section. An employee has the right to refuse (in good faith) to be exposed to an imminent danger. Section 11(c) protects employees from their employers taking adverse action against them, if that action would not have been taken but for the employee’s exercise of rights guaranteed by OSHA. Examples of these rights include participating in OSHA inspections, conferences, hearings, or other OSHA-related activities; participating on a workplace safety and health committee or in union activities concerning job safety and health; filing safety or health job grievances; complaining to an employer, a union, the media, OSHA or any other government agency about safety and health hazards; requesting to see material safety data sheets or other documents that the employer is required to share with employees upon request; and so on"
In which section of the Occupational Safety and Health Act is the “general duty” clause found?,Section 5(a)(1)
What is the purpose of 29 CFR 1910.106?,"The regulation 29 CFR 1910.106 governs the handling, storage, and use of flammable liquids with a flash point below 200°F, primarily to mitigate risks of explosions and fires."
What standard is the primary basis for 29 CFR 1910.106?,"The National Fire Protection Association's NFPA 30, Flammable Liquids Code, serves as the primary basis for this standard."
What are the two primary hazards associated with flammable liquids as mentioned in the document?,The two primary hazards are explosions and fires.
How does 29 CFR 1910.106 address the hazards of flammable liquids?,"It addresses these hazards through standards on design and construction, ventilation, ignition sources, and storage requirements."
"What defines an ""approved"" container or storage method under this regulation?","An ""approved"" method or container is one that is listed by a nationally recognized testing laboratory."
What is the significance of a liquid's boiling point in terms of safety?,The boiling point indicates the temperature at which a liquid can change to vapor; liquids with lower boiling points pose greater fire risks due to higher vapor pressures at normal temperatures.
What is a closed container?,A closed container is one that is sealed in such a way that neither liquid nor vapor can escape at ordinary temperatures.
How is the flash point of a liquid determined?,The flash point is determined by heating the liquid and measuring the temperature at which a small flame ignites the vapors above the liquid.
What are flammable liquid categories based on?,"Flammable liquids are categorized based on their flash points and boiling points, with four categories outlined based on these properties."
How should flammable liquids be stored in terms of fire protection equipment?,They should be stored away from sprinkler systems or water discharge units to ensure effective functioning of fire protection equipment.
What dictates the placement of portable fire extinguishers in storage areas?,Extinguishers must be placed strategically to be accessible during a fire but not so close as to be unreachable due to flames.
What are the implications of storing flammable liquids in general-purpose public warehouses?,"Specific storage requirements must be followed, and storage of incompatible materials is prohibited to prevent fire hazards."
Why must flammable liquids be stored away from egress paths?,To ensure that paths used for emergency exits remain clear and accessible at all times.
What determines the categorization of flammable liquids for storage purposes?,"Liquids are categorized based on their flash points and boiling points, affecting storage regulations."

"In seeking employee acceptance of the safety program, explain the role that managers should play","Managers should operate in the role of a coach. A coach teaches, guides, inspires a willingness to do the right thing, and fosters a genuine feeling of trust. When acting in that role and encouraging participation in the system, employees are not only safe to speak out; they feel obligated in a positive way to speak out. Similarly, such a coach can, in a nonauthoritarian manner, help employees to establish and secure a prosafety attitude and a consistent pattern of safe behavior."
Why should the ideas of “line employees” be considered in addition to those of engineers and safety professionals?,"Line employees can often provide practical suggestions that even the engineer, Ph.D., and CEO cannot. They frequently possess a better understanding of the day-to-day operation of their machine. They may know how to make it better and safer. They may know why accidents can or do happen on it, even if management just cannot . They may know how to beat it, a bad habit often motivated by piecework."
List at least three kinds of facilities that are apart from the main building and must be inspected.,"Storage sheds and stationary trailers, compressor shacks, garages, silos, tanks, guardhouses, and treatment facilities"
List at least three hazards commonly found on roofs.,"Hazards involving HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning equipment), particularly unguarded or inadequately guarded power transmission equipment in the form of fan blades, belts, chains, and pulley; the lack of perimeter protection in the vicinity of items, near the roof edge: HVAC, pipes, access points from ladders or hatches, communication equipment, signs, lighting, and security cameras"
Must all electrical and mechanical equipment (to which your employees are likely to be exposed) be “OSHA-approved?”,"Products, including equipment are not OSHA-approved, but they may meet OSHA requirements if used and maintained as designed and intended, which includes use in the proper location"
"Name at least five categories of safety-related items, besides personal protective equipment, for which an easy-access documented inventory must be available.","Fire extinguishers, testing and sampling instruments, spill-neutralizing agents, locks and keys, tags, labels, batteries, signs, flashlights, first-aid supplied, hoisting/rigging slings and electrical extension cords"
Why must equipment labeling be unambiguous?,Equipment labeling should not be ambiguous so that items are not missed during inspections and so that the correct items are checked. Injuries can occur if there is a false sense of security when the wrong equipment has been “fixed” or inspected.
Does “inflammable” mean flammable or nonflammable? What is wrong with using “inflammable” on a label?,"“Inflammable” means flammable. Many people think thank it means that because it stars with “in-“ that it is the opposite of flammable, and therefore may not use an item with this label in the correct manner leading to serious consequences."
What is the central underlying objective of an occupational safety and health program?,"The central underlying objective of an occupational safety and health overall program is to minimize risk. In turn, all elements of the program should be directed toward one unqualified goal: accident prevention."
Is it advisable to have your safety program driven by mod rates and pie charts? Why or why not?,"No, this type of program tends to be dysfunctional. These companies suffer the disability of tunnel vision and only see neatly diagrammed statistical indicators. All too often, they overlook accidents waiting to happen because they have concentrated too keenly on the types of accidents that have already occurred."
Should safety committees have more management members or more labor force members?,Should safety committees have more management members or more labor force members?
What is the main purpose of an accident investigation?,The main purpose of an accident investigation is to preclude or greatly reduce the chances of a recurrence. Accidents can be reasonably predicted and prevention in most cases.
Give an example of an incident that was directly related to an act of nature and resulted in a serious injury but could have been prevented?,"Employees being stung by a bee, employee killed in a flood when the establishment is in a flood plain"
Briefly explain the problem with describing an incident as a “freak accident”.,"When this excuse is to be believed, the idea is that the accident was not even remotely foreseeable. The next thought is that there is nothing that can be done to avoid a similar incident so there is no purpose in even conducting more than a cursory accident investigation. Therein lies the danger of the “freak accident” label. It is a way to increase the chances of another person suffering because no controls are brought into the picture."
Give at least three types of trends that may become apparent on injury/illness logs.,"Trends may appear when multiple cases involve the same department, occupation, task, part of the body, diagnosis, or victim. There may also be a reponderance of cases relating to the same supervisor, shift, or approximate time of day. An even more detailed study could show that employees are being injured early in the work week, late in the work week, or while working overtime."
"Is it conceivable, or is it mere bunk, that some employees may have a tendency to (and/or are better-suited to) work more safely on certain shifts?","However, some employees have adapted to extremely early morning hours and actually perform well. Others (giving credence to the term “night people”) may thrive at those hours without the need for adaptation. The general issue is an important one. There should be no assumption that particular employees will easily adjust to long or unfamiliar hours simply because they are motivated to do so."
"If the OSHA compliance officer determined (by use of a circuit tester) that an electrical receptacle was ungrounded, what might be a fair and reasonable defense?","If it is not visibly obvious that there was at least outward damage, there was no pattern of receptacle hazards, and there was no evidence of shocks or flying sparks, then the employer should be in a position to assert that there was no reason to determine that he or she should have known. You can support this argument with the fact that the electrical receptacles were installed by a licensed electrician and that you have periodically used a circuit tester to spot-check receptacles in general. After all, you are not automatically obligated to test all of the receptacles every week"
"What are the numerous arguments that the employer must successfully offer, to bolster a defense of “isolated incident?”","The company has established an adequate work rule designed to prevent the violation, had adequately communicated the rule to the employees, had taken steps to discover violations, and had effectively enforced the rules when violations had been discovered. There is a far greater chance that the defense will be upheld when there have been sanctions, such as reprimands and the docking of pay, prior to the inspection."
"Briefly, under what circumstances may OSHA allege a “willful” violation?",“Willful” may be cited if the violation was committed voluntarily with either an intentional or purposeful disregard for the requirements of the Act or with plain indifference to employee safety.
How should aisles in storage areas be maintained?,They should be at least 3 feet wide to ensure clear paths for emergency access and routine operations.
What are the conditions for storage cabinets within fire-resistance rated areas?,Cabinets must be constructed to prevent the internal temperature from exceeding specified limits during a fire test.
What is required for ventilation in flammable liquid storage rooms?,Rooms need a ventilation system capable of replacing the air at least six times per hour to prevent vapor accumulation.
What specifies the construction standards for storage rooms?,"Storage rooms must meet fire test standards such as those in NFPA 251-1969, ensuring they can contain fires and prevent the spread of flammable vapors."
How should flammable liquids be handled if stored for maintenance or operation of equipment in office settings?,They should be kept in closed metal containers within storage cabinets or rooms not accessible to the public.
"What are the general requirements for storage outside buildings?",Storage must comply with specific guidelines to prevent spill diversion towards buildings and ensure security against tampering and trespassing.
What fire protection systems are recommended for areas storing flammable liquids?,"Systems like sprinklers, water spray, or carbon dioxide systems are advised to control or extinguish fires."
What is prohibited during the transfer of flammable liquids inside buildings?,Using air pressure on containers or tanks during transfer is prohibited to prevent overpressure and the creation of flammable atmospheres.
How must flammable liquids be handled at the point of final use in workplaces?,They should be kept in covered containers unless being used and transferred using safe methods like closed piping systems or approved valves to prevent spills and vapor release.
What limitations are placed on the storage of flammable liquids in industrial settings?,Quantities are limited based on the category of the liquid and the type of container or storage area used.
In what types of operations can flammable liquids be used according to the scope of industrial plants?,"They can be used in operations like mixing, drying, and filtering where no chemical reaction is involved, excluding chemical plants and refineries."
How should incompatible materials be stored relative to flammable liquids?,"Materials that react with water, which might be used in fire control, should not be stored in the same room as flammable liquids to avoid hazardous reactions."
What does the prohibition on open flames in storage areas imply?,"This rule is to prevent ignition of flammable vapors, which could lead to fires or explosions."
What is the required fire control equipment for areas where flammable liquids are stored?,"Suitable fire control devices like portable fire extinguishers must be available, with specific requirements on their placement relative to storage areas."
What special provisions are there for storage rooms inside buildings?,These rooms must have proper ventilation and wiring approved for hazardous locations depending on the flashpoint of the stored liquids.
How should flammable liquids be stored in relation to building exits?,"They should not be stored in ways that block exits, stairways, or areas used for safe egress."
What are the maximum storage quantities for Category 1 and Category 4 flammable liquids in cabinets?,"No more than 60 gallons of Category 1, 2, or 3 and no more than 120 gallons of Category 4 flammable liquids may be stored in one cabinet."
What requirements exist for storage cabinets containing flammable liquids?,Cabinets must limit internal temperatures and be labeled clearly; they must also be constructed to withstand a fire test without losing integrity.
How are flammable liquids to be dispensed?,"Liquids must be dispensed using approved pumps or self-closing faucets to minimize the risk of spills and vapor release."
What is the significance of maintaining aisles within storage areas?,"Aisles ensure easy movement, reducing the risk of spills and providing clear access for firefighting and escape during emergencies."
"What is meant by ""flammable (explosive) limits""?","These limits refer to the range of vapor-air mixtures that are combustible; outside these limits, the mixture is either too ""lean"" or too ""rich"" to burn."
What role does vapor pressure play in flammable liquid safety?,"Vapor pressure indicates how readily a liquid will evaporate, influencing its volatility and the likelihood of vapor formation, which can lead to fires."
Should the employer plan to “go to work” on cited items as soon as the citation arrives?,"Yes, if not beforehand. Convene a meeting of your previously selected team, identifying which individuals will spearhead your efforts to comply with the citation(s) if you feel that such a course of action is proper. You should also identify those persons who will be able to contribute to your efforts to fight aspects of the citation(s), if appropriate."
Should the employer always request the longest/latest abatement date?,"Not always; some hazards are easily controlled or eliminated immediately and can be abated before the citation arrives. By continually requesting 2 years for abating violations, you throw away an opportunity to work with the compliance officer in good faith and may end up with shorter abatement dates than if you offered sensible reasons for longer ones."
List at least three factors that can be considered as mitigating circumstances regarding a hazard,"extensive training and experience of potentially exposed personnel, partial guarding or other protection, the use of personal protective equipment where it can reduce the probability of injury/illness or reduce the severity of any injury or illness, good housekeeping in the immediate area (relating to a lack of slip/trip hazards and an excess of working/walking space), good lighting, warning signs, the visibly obvious nature of the hazard (not necessarily a factor in your favor, but could be helpful), and slow speeds or little force regarding moving parts of machinery"
List at least five factors that can be considered as exacerbating circumstances regarding a hazard.,"high noise levels, poor visibility, high stress including piecework, inadequate training, tripping or slipping hazards (e.g., near unguarded moving parts), crowded conditions, poor illumination, hazards that could surface unexpectedly (automatically starting/cycling equipment with unguarded moving parts, e.g., compressors)"
"If the OSHA compliance officer observes a machine that lacks required guarding, and the employer points out an identical machine that is properly guarded, how can that supposed defense be counterproductive?",It establishes the employer’s knowledge of proper guarding.
List at least three ways that an employer may have gained knowledge of a hazard.,"The hazard may be visually obvious, attention may have been drawn to the hazard by an accident that had occurred, or employees may have brought concerns about hazards to management’s attention."
Should OSHA initiate a complaint inspection if the complainant is considered a disgruntled employee? Explain.,"Yes, OSHA should still initiate the inspection. Even if the complainant is considered “disgruntled,” that is not sufficient reason for denying the issuance of a warrant. Motivation should not be a factor. The key question is whether or not OSHA believes that the hazardous conditions described by the complainant are likely to exist and constitute violations. Frequently, employers gripe that the complainant must be a disgruntled employee. That argument is presented as if a disgruntled employee has no right to complain. He or she has every right. Why is that employee disgruntled? The answer may be a direct outcropping of the unsafe and/or unhealthful conditions at the workplace. Even if that employee is a chronic complainer about matters including those unrelated to safety and health, he or she may be offering well-conceived concerns about occupational hazards"
It is always wise for the employer to show OSHA the training records and the safety committee notes.,False; certain paperwork may reveal “willful” violoations or highlight that noted hazards have yet to be abated.
What are some of the circumstances under which OSHA might issue a subpoena duces tecum?,A subpoena for production of records (subpoena duces tecum) will normally be served if the employer did not accede to a compliance officer’s examination of OSHA-required records.
Should you ask to see the OSHA compliance officer’s credentials upon arrival? What should you do if there is any doubt of identity?,"Yes, credentials should be inspected immediately. If there is any doubt at all that the person is a compliance safety and health officer, you should call the OSHA area office or equivalent state agency. If the officer is an imposter, the FBI and local authorities should be contacted."
Who should speak with the compliance officer after credentials have been verified?,"An employer representative of significant authority, such as an owner, operator, or agent in charge of the workplace"
"When an OSHA compliance officer begins the walk-around inspection process, it is advisable that he/she not be accompanied by an employer representative.",False; a representative should walk around with the inspector and perform a side-byside inspection as well as film the inspection
What is the receptionist’s involvement in an inspection?,Receptionists should be aware of the steps to be taken when the OSHA officer enters the premises so that they do not roam around the facility. The receptionist should know where the officer should wait and contact the proper management official immediately.
When is the best time to perform an initial JHA?,It is best to perform job hazard analyses when the jobs are in the design and planning stages.
"When might an ergonomist test an employee’s physical ability, and how would the ergonomist perform the test?","An ergonomist or other professional may test physical ability when there are real doubts as to whether all individuals can perform a job task in a reasonably safe manner. The testing must employ an objective, discernibly reliable method that is not just a general strength evaluation, but one that can address specific movements necessary for job-task performance. One way to do this is to have the employees lift a stable weight through the actual range of motions required by the particular tasks."
The employer is obligated to report to OSHA an occupational fatality only if it resulted from a violation of an OSHA standard.,"False; if there is a fatality that resulted from a work-related incident, it must be verbally reported to the relevant OSHA area office or by using the OSHA toll-free central telephone number within 8 hr following the employee’s death."
What is a simple explanation of the purpose of an Employee Assistance Program?,An EAP is a program designed to help employees cope with personal problems and pressures that adversely impact on job performance and general well-being.
"Good health is merely the absence of disease, ailment, injury, or illness.","False; from a holistic perspective, it is also a state of mind and body that yields a feeling of well-being. From this broad perspective, a truly healthy person consistently approaches life with a spirit and vigor that cause self-contentment to thrive."
Should substance abuse programs only address illegal drugs?,"No, they should also address alcohol, legal drugs used in excess, and the combination of alcohol and legal drugs."
Can incentive programs serve as the major component of an overall safety program?,"No incentive program can serve as the major part of an overall safety program. However, if formulated and implemented within the proper framework, it can shore up gaps that allowed risks to remain or to surface. It can aid in the philosophy of employee self-regulation and show a most worthwhile return on investment."
What is a portable tank as defined in the summary?,"A portable tank is a closed container with a capacity over 60 gallons, not intended for fixed installation."
"What does the term ""low flash - high hazard"" signify?","It signifies that liquids with lower flash points pose higher risks as they generate vapors faster, which can lead to rapid flame spread."
How should a Category 3 flammable liquid be handled when heated near its flash point?,"If a Category 3 liquid with a flash point above 100°F is heated within 30°F of its flash point, it must be treated as if it has a flash point below 100°F."
Can OSHA’s guidelines create legal obligations?,"OSHA’s guidelines are intended as tools for addressing workplace hazards and do not create additional legal obligations beyond those defined by statute, regulations, and standards."
What are the primary means of controlling hazards according to industrial hygienists?,"Engineering, work practice, and administrative controls are the primary methods used to reduce employee exposure to occupational hazards"
What is the function of engineering controls in industrial hygiene?,Engineering controls involve minimizing exposure by reducing or removing the hazard at the source or isolating the worker from the hazard.
How are air contaminants classified?,"Air contaminants are classified as particulate (dusts, fumes, mists, aerosols, fibers) or gas and vapor contaminants."
What are the primary effects of chemical hazards?,"Chemical hazards exert toxic effects through inhalation, absorption, or ingestion, and can be corrosive to living tissue."
How do work practice controls enhance workplace safety?,"Work practice controls change how tasks are performed, including proper procedures that minimize exposures while operating production and control equipment."
What is the main risk associated with electricity in the workplace?,"Electricity poses significant risks in the workplace, such as electric shock, electrocution, burns, fires, and explosions. These can be fatal or cause severe injuries."

"In emergency situations, how quickly must the host employer relay new or changing information to the contact employer?","OSHA recognizes that conditions may change rapidly during restoration work after an emergency and that information about the status of the system is relayed to the host employer by multiple sources. The host employer must engage in reasonable efforts to transmit required information to contract employers as quickly as practicable after it becomes available. The Agency emphasizes that during storm or emergency restoration efforts, it is particularly important for host employers and contract employers to keep employees informed through thorough job briefings pursuant to 29 CFR 1910.269(c) and 29 CFR 1926.952 and through other appropriate mechanisms, such as using designated points of contact between the host employer and contract employers."
Does the information the host employer must provide to the contract employer vary depending on whether the work is done in normal circumstances or during an emergency?,"No. OSHA requires the host employer to provide the contract employer with information that is related to the safety of the work to be performed during both emergency and nonemergency work. However, certain information may be related to the safety of work performed in typical nonemergency conditions, but not to the safety of work performed in an emergency. For example, information regarding the condition of poles may not be related to the safety of the work to be performed in an emergency situation in which the poles were knocked down by a storm."
"During an emergency (for example, following a major storm), does the host employer need to use the same methods of providing information to contract employers that it uses in other, nonemergency, situations?","No. OSHA does not specify how the required information is to be transferred. Host employers do not need to follow the same procedure in every situation. For example, a host employer may follow different information transfer procedures during restoration work following a storm. In all situations, OSHA will deem it sufficient for the host employer to provide the necessary information through any appropriate mechanism to an authorized agent of the contact employer. A communication method is appropriate as long as it effectively communicates the required information to the contract employer. See the response to Question 8 under “Information Transfer” for additional guidance."
"Paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B) of 29 CFR 1910.269 and paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of 29 CFR 1926.950 provide that, before work begins, the host employer inform contract employers of certain known conditions that are related to the safety of the work to be performed and that are listed in 29 CFR 1910.269(a)(4)(vi) through (a)(4)(viii), and 29 CFR 1926.950(d)(6) - 10 - through (d)(8), respectively. These listed conditions include “[e]nvironmental conditions relating to safety” (see 29 CFR 1910.269(a)(4)(viii) and 29 CFR 1926.950(d)(8)). What does the term “environmental conditions” mean in this context?","Paragraph (a)(4) of 29 CFR 1910.269 and paragraph (d) of 29 CFR 1926.950 address only “characteristics and conditions of electric lines and equipment.” Therefore, the host employer is required to inform contract employers of known safety-related environmental conditions only to the extent they relate to electric lines and equipment. For example, the host employer must inform the contract employer of known ground conditions that impact the stability of, or an employee’s ability to safely climb, a pole. Similarly, in generating plants, the host employer is required to inform contract employers of the known presence of coal dust or fly ash to the extent the presence of those substances relate to electric lines or equipment. The information-transfer provisions do not require host employers to provide information about environmental conditions that do not both affect worker safety and relate to electric lines and equipment."

Are contract employers required to report hazardous conditions that they do not discover or recognize?","No. The reporting requirement is limited to hazardous conditions that contract employers discover during their work and recognize as hazards. However, OSHA expects that contract employers will generally be able to recognize hazards at the worksite to which their own employees may be exposed. If a contract employer fails to train employees to recognize the hazards relevant to the safety of their work, the Agency will cite the contract employer under applicable training provisions, not for a violation of the information-transfer provisions. OSHA notes that 29 CFR 1910.269(a)(3)(ii)(C) and 29 CFR 1926.950(c)(2)(iii) do not require contract employers to report to host employers hazards to which the contract employer’s employees are not exposed. Nothing in the information-transfer provisions requires contract employers to perform worksite inspections intended to identify hazards that are not related to the safety of the work performed by their own employees"
"Paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(C) of 29 CFR 1910.269 and paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of 29 CFR 1926.950 require the contract employer to “advise the host employer of any unanticipated hazardous conditions found during the contract employer’s work that the host employer did not mention” under 29 CFR 1910.269(a)(3)(i) and 29 CFR 1926.950(c)(1), respectively. Is the term “unanticipated hazardous conditions” limited to conditions that relate to the electric lines and equipment?","OSHA uses the term “conditions,” in 29 CFR 1910.269(a)(3)(ii)(C) and 29 CFR 1926.950(c)(2)(iii), to refer to conditions addressed in 29 CFR 1910.269(a)(4) and 29 CFR 1926.950(d), which cover “conditions of electric lines and equipment that are related to the safety of the work to be performed.” Thus, hazards in the working environment are “conditions” that must be reported under 29 CFR 1910.269(a)(3)(ii)(C) and 29 CFR 1926.950(c)(2)(iii) only if they relate to electric lines and equipment."
How does the response to part (a) of this question apply if the contract employer is performing line-clearance tree trimming work covered by 29 CFR 1910.269?,The response to part (a) of this question does not apply to line-clearance tree trimming work covered by 29 CFR 1910.269 because the assessment requirements in 29 CFR 1910.269(l) do not apply when line-clearance tree trimming is performed by lineclearance tree trimmers who are not qualified employees.

Is the employer required to train employees with regard to hazards that do not pertain to their job duties?,"No. Paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) of 29 CFR 1910.269 and paragraph (b)(1)(i) of 29 CFR 1926.950 require that “[e]ach employee . . . be trained in, and familiar with, the safetyrelated work practices, safety procedures, and other safety requirements in [29 CFR 1910.269 and 29 CFR Part 1926, Subpart V, respectively] that pertain to his or her job assignments.” Consequently, employers are not required to train employees with regard to hazards that do not pertain to their job duties."
Does OSHA anticipate that these provisions will require employers to make significant changes to training programs developed when 29 CFR 1910.269 was originally promulgated in 1994?,"OSHA does not expect these provisions to require employers to change training programs already provided under the prior version of 29 CFR 1910.269. Rather, the provisions provide employers with options to tailor their training programs and resources to employees with particularly high-risk jobs. The Agency notes, however, that employers - 2 - will need to update their existing training programs as necessary to ensure employees receive adequate training in all new or revised provisions in the versions of 29 CFR 1910.269 and 29 CFR Part 1926, Subpart V that were promulgated on April 11, 2014 (for example, the revised provisions on minimum approach distances and the new requirements for arc-rated protection)."

What are the criteria for safety signs and tags under OSHA?,Safety signs and tags must be used where necessary to warn about specific hazards that could lead to accidental injury or property damage. Tags should withstand environmental conditions and be securely attached.
What provisions does OSHA provide for agricultural workers?,"OSHA provides specific standards for agriculture that cover general environmental controls, agricultural equipment, and field sanitation, among others."
"I work in construction, and we frequently use ladders. What are the OSHA regulations for safe ladder use?","OSHA covers ladder safety in detail under 29 CFR 1926.1050 & 1926.1060. Key points include: Selecting the right ladder for the job, maintaining three points of contact while climbing, and ensuring the ladder is secured and on level ground."
Our factory uses various chemicals.  How do I know if there's a safe exposure limit for a specific chemical?,"OSHA sets Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) for many hazardous chemicals. You can find a list with specific limits in 29 CFR 1910.1000, also known as the Table Z-1."
I'm concerned about the amount of noise in my office environment. Does OSHA have regulations for noise exposure?,"Yes, OSHA regulates workplace noise under 29 CFR 1910.95. The regulation establishes an Action Level at 85 decibels (dBA) and a Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) at 90 dBA over an 8-hour workday."
We're planning on renovating our office building. Are there any specific OSHA regulations for construction in existing buildings?,"OSHA covers renovations under the general construction standards 29 CFR 1926. Additionally, if lead-based paint is suspected, specific regulations in 29 CFR 1926.62 apply."
I noticed some damaged electrical cords in my workplace.  Who is responsible for ensuring electrical safety?,OSHA electrical safety standards are in 29 CFR 1910.331-399. Both employers and employees share responsibility. Employers must maintain electrical equipment and have a written electrical safety program if  programmable controllers are used. Employees should avoid using damaged cords and report any electrical hazards.
Our warehouse has several elevated platforms for storing materials.  Is there an OSHA standard for guardrails?,"Yes, fall protection standards are covered in 29 CFR 1910.23 & 1926.500. Guardrails are required around all open-sided elevated platforms, walkways, and floor openings where falls could occur."
What type of fire extinguisher should I use for a grease fire in the kitchen?,"Never use a water extinguisher on a grease fire! Class K extinguishers are designed for kitchen fires involving grease, fats, and oils.

What are the requirements for providing eyewash stations in the workplace?,OSHA mandates eyewash stations and safety showers in areas where there is a potential for eye or body flushing due to hazardous chemicals. Specific requirements are in 29 CFR 1910.151.
Our workplace uses respirators for certain tasks.  Does OSHA require a respirator fit test?,"Yes,  OSHA's respiratory protection standard 29 CFR 1910.134 mandates a medical evaluation and respirator fit test before using any tight-fitting respirator."
The best type of incentive program focuses on a lack of injuries.,"False; these types are the most common, but the more meaningful incentive programs center on good work performance. In such cases, the danger of not reporting is irrelevant. Employees are rewarded for positive actions as opposed to the lack of negative results."
"Why consider rewarding individuals who submit many pro-safety suggestions, even though none of those ideas bears fruit?","Even if several ideas do not bear fruit, one might produce an orchard. You want to inspire employees to generate a flow of ideas."
"Give at least three means of abating tripping hazards presented by electrical cords and cables, and telephone and network wiring.","Use rubber-type, beveled runners designed to protect cords and cables in a covered channel, while minimizing trip potential, or consider moving furniture or equipment, adding receptacles or jacks, consolidating, or using cordless telephones."
"Should all inspections be conducted on a specific, regular schedule? Explain.","Although there may be times when inspections are announced, there is no question that many inspections must be conducted as surprises. In virtually all cases, OSHA inspections are unannounced and it is best to simulate OSHA inspections for the most part. Do not give employees the opportunity to neaten up for an inspection, to replace guards, to scurry to don personal protective equipment, or to put out cigarettes. See the shop the way it normally runs. Period. Vary the route and order of the tour. This will help remove the predictability of when a certain area will be entered for inspection. Drop-in at midnight, inspect, then (this can be interesting) return in an hour."
Give an example of when a “NOT AN EXIT” sign should be posted,"If a door, archway, or similar opening could reasonably be mistaken for an exit or a way to an exit, even though it is not, then there should be a sign indicating Not an Exit or indicating the actual character of the opening (Boiler Room, Supply Closet, etc.)"
What is a potential problem with a sign placed on a door?,"Doors may be left open, at an angle that precludes a view of the sign when walking toward the opening. If the door is opened into the room or space to be entered, sometimes the sign is only spotted when the person has already passed through the door frame; when the door is opened far beyond 90 degrees, the person may walk by the sign and miss it entirely. If the door is opened away from the room or space to be entered (toward the would-be reader), there is an even greater chance that the sign will go unnoticed; it may now be behind (on the other side of) the door surface that remains in view. If an evacuee does not see the exit sign on a door, he or she may well waste time going to an exit that is farther away. If the unseen sign was for indicating a direction not to be taken for exiting, an evacuee may assume the opposite and enter an area that does not provide escape. Similarly, a person may enter a space that is not a dead end (as there is an escape route to the exterior), but it would still be a poor choice to do so. In such case, the evacuee could be forced to go through a space containing (for example) flammable liquid storage, acetylene and oxygen, or other high hazard concerns. A sign that is on a door, but is not visually evident, may be unrelated to egress decisions; it may be posted to warn about particular hazards (and/or the need for personal protective equipment) in the space beyond the door."
What is the problem with a sign simply stating (for example) “WARNING: ARGON PURGE?”,The words do not suitably command the attention of the reader. The warning should have clearly imparted the message that there was a grave danger of oxygen deficiency.
What is one potential “added value” of inserting a hand-out in the envelope with the paycheck?,"When a handout accompanies a check in an envelope (particularly if it is mailed), there is the possibility that the spouse may take a look at it and encourage the employee to read it."
"The more information on hand-outs, the better.",False; you do not want to overwhelm the employee ewith handouts that are too long or too complex.
Should all safety posters and banners be displayed in the same place and position at all times? Why or why not?,"No, after a while, they become the equivalent of invisible if they remain in the same location. Therefore, their locations should be rotated for maximum effect"

What happens after an emergency plan is implemented?,"The implementation is documented, including a description of the scenario, actions taken, participants, and a critique identifying strengths and areas for improvement."
What does the Shelter-in-Place Plan specifically address?,"It addresses emergencies resulting from hazardous materials releases, either accidental or from national security incidents, and other scenarios like nearby gunfire or imminent tornadoes where it's safer inside than outside."
What triggers the initiation of Shelter-in-Place procedures?,Procedures are initiated based on information from local police and fire departments indicating that remaining inside is safer than evacuating.
What is the role of OSHA Managers during a shelter-in-place?,"They are responsible for notifying all OSHA employees, enhancing building safety, and conducting air quality monitoring."
How should employees relocate during a shelter-in-place?,"Employees, contractors, and visitors should relocate to designated shelter areas within the building, close doors to vacated offices, and remain there until an all-clear message is announced."
What should employees do if they decide to leave the building during a shelter-in-place?,"They should be aware that re-entry might not be allowed, and other locations may not be accessible due to similar shelter-in-place protocols."

How should employees react during an earthquake according to the plan?,"Take cover under sturdy furniture or against an interior wall, stay away from windows and large objects, and follow instructions from emergency personnel."
I work in a restaurant kitchen with hot oil and open flames.  What are the OSHA regulations for preventing burns?,"OSHA  requires employers to implement a hazard communication program (29 CFR 1910.1200) to identify and label hazardous chemicals, including hot oil.  Additionally, employers must provide appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) like heat-resistant gloves and aprons (29 CFR 1910.132)."
"We're renovating our bathroom at work, and there's a chance we might encounter asbestos.  What should we do?"," Asbestos exposure is a serious health hazard.  OSHA  regulates asbestos abatement in specific detail under 29 CFR 1926.1101.  If you suspect asbestos,  stop work immediately and  consult a licensed asbestos abatement contractor."
I'm a delivery driver and frequently lift heavy packages.  What are some safe lifting practices to avoid back injuries?,"While OSHA doesn't mandate specific lifting techniques, they encourage employers to develop safe lifting programs (29 CFR 1910.500).  Common safe lifting practices include  bending at the knees, keeping the back straight, and avoiding twisting while lifting."
Our office building doesn't seem to have proper ventilation.  Is there an OSHA standard for indoor air quality?,"OSHA doesn't have a specific indoor air quality standard, but they do regulate certain indoor air contaminants like  carbon monoxide (29 CFR 1910.1000).  If you're concerned about poor ventilation,  address it with your employer or building management."
"I work in construction, and dust from cutting concrete is a constant issue.  What are my rights regarding dust exposure?","OSHA regulates exposure limits for various airborne contaminants, including silica dust from concrete (29 CFR 1910.1000).  Employers must  provide dust masks or respirators  to protect workers exceeding the exposure limit."
A co-worker spilled a large amount of cleaning solution on the floor.  How should I proceed safely?,"First,  warn others to avoid the spill.  If the cleaning solution is labeled with hazard warnings,  consult the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for proper  cleanup procedures (29 CFR 1910.1200).  If unsure, or if the spill is large,  contact your supervisor for further instructions."
Our factory uses forklifts to move heavy pallets.  What safety precautions should be taken?,OSHA forklift safety standards are outlined in 29 CFR 1910.178.  Only trained and certified operators are allowed to operate forklifts.  The workplace should also have designated traffic lanes for forklifts and pedestrians.
I noticed some exposed electrical wires in the storage room.  Who is responsible for fixing this hazard?,OSHA electrical safety standards are in 29 CFR 1910.331-399.  Employers are responsible for ensuring electrical equipment is properly maintained and addressing any exposed wiring hazards.  Report the issue to your supervisor immediately.
I'm lifting a heavy box and feel a sharp pain in my back.  What should I do?,Report the work-related injury to your supervisor as soon as possible.  OSHA requires employers to maintain records of work-related injuries and illnesses (29 CFR 1904.31).  Seek medical attention if necessary.
Our workplace doesn't have a written safety plan.  Is this required by OSHA?,"While OSHA doesn't mandate a written safety plan for all workplaces,  it's a best practice  to establish procedures for  hazard communication, emergency response, and accident prevention (29 CFR 1910.38)."
What are the main purposes of progressive discipline?,A progressive discipline plan should help convince those employees who still are not sufficiently motivated.
"Should an employee, who knowingly uses equipment that is unsafe (as obvious and as discerned in training) due to having been damaged, be disciplined if he/she did not cause the damage?",Yes; employees should be encouraged to report unsafe conditions without discipline even if they caused the damage.
Excellent training can overcome unsafe working conditions.,"False; training, no matter how effectively done, cannot take the place of safe work conditions. For instance, training should not have to include a warning to work carefully around unguarded machinery or to walk carefully when descending stairs that lack railings. The machines should be guarded, and the stairs should have railings."
What is a value of training scheduling being coordinated with the personnel office?,"It is advantageous to avoid staggered hiring, which results in two persons starting work on the 1st of the month, three on the 5th of that month, and then two more on the 8th. It is much easier and much more practical to have them all start at the same time so they can all be trained at once. Otherwise, there is a proven tendency to not train the persons hired on the 1st and 5th until the 8th, when the last of the group is brought on board. Then, they will all be trained together. Of course, that puts the new employees and possibly those that they might endanger in jeopardy until the 8th."
What are the benefits of on-the-job training as opposed to just listening to a lecture or a presentation?,"If employees are observed engaging in unsafe behavior, they should be stopped as soon as practicable, but not by startling, and the correct behavior should be explained. All too often while in the course of an inspection, the safety director, foreperson, or other person witnesses unsafe behavior, but chooses to not bring it up until he or she writes a memo or until a meeting is held. It is essential to stop the unsafe act as soon as possible. If follow-up documentation is to be instituted, it can be dealt with later. In that case, and with any form of training, the trainer is burdened with the responsibility of convincing employees that complying with safety regulations is to their advantage. They must understand exactly why. The answer cannot lie in some general philosophical cloud. Employees must understand cause and effect."
Should apparent violations of OSHA standards always be abated before hazards not related to specific OSHA standards? Explain.,"Not necessarily; there are often conditions and practices that, while not in violation of the law, present hazardous situations. OSHA standards are minimal. It is a good idea to exceed them, not just for personal protective equipment (addressed elsewhere in more detail), but for such subjects as guarding of belts, gears, chains, couplings, fan blades, and similar moving parts."
What are the main criteria for determining priorities?,"If someone gets hurt or sick due to the unsafe or unhealthful situation, what is the reasonably predictable severity of injury or illness (always leaning toward the more severe)? What is the probability of a related accident resulting in injury or illness? How many persons are exposed to the hazards?"
"Employees may remove covers from enclosed spaces (such as manholes or vaults) to hang warning tags or to facilitate viewing of structure identification tags or badges. Does the removal of a cover from an enclosed space constitute “entry,” as defined in 29 CFR 1910.269(x) and 29 CFR 1926.968, where no part of the employee’s body breaks the plane of the opening into the space during the removal of the cover? Does the use of a tool to hang a tag in an enclosed space constitute “entry,” as defined in 29 CFR 1910.269(x) and 29 CFR 1926.968, where the tool, but no part of the employee’s body, breaks the plane of the opening into the space during the use of the tool?","No entry will have occurred under either of the circumstances described. However, an entry does occur if any part of the employee’s body breaks the plane of the opening. OSHA notes that 29 CFR 1910.269(e)(5) and 29 CFR 1926.953(f) require that, “[w]hen covers are removed from enclosed spaces, the opening shall be promptly guarded by a railing, temporary cover, or other barrier designed to prevent an accidental fall through the opening and to protect employees working in the space from objects entering the space.” Compliance with these provisions should help ensure that employees do not enter the space unintentionally or accidentally"
Anyone working on a PV installation site may operate a forklift,"False, Any workers operating forklifts must be certified to operate a forklift and authorized by their employers to operate a forklift. A worker who does not have these credentials may not operate a forklift."
